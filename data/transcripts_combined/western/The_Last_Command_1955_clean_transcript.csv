military commander arrested him,370.139,5.28,372.779
one Brad burned that'd be you know him,372.0,5.94,374.97
without knowing much more about it I'm,377.94,6.5,381.19
inclined to be on lawyer Travis side,379.8,4.64,382.12
let's keep walking,402.9,4.68,405.23999999999995
I know exactly where you're going you'll,404.84,4.0,406.84

governor and I know how you operate,443.639,6.301,446.78950000000003
I do not operate with stupid idiots who,447.0,4.319,449.1595
are so obvious they get themselves in,449.94,2.699,451.2895
seems to me you're in a little trouble,452.639,2.641,453.9595

Province the Texans were getting hot,459.24,3.06,460.77
under the collar because you'd been,461.099,2.88,462.539
playing too rough with him did you,462.3,3.66,464.13
planted Spies all around him that you,463.979,3.181,465.5695

make arresting that lawyer Travis,467.16,4.74,469.53000000000003
sending him to Mexico City tomorrow,469.319,5.461,472.0495
is a revolutionary a traitor a big,471.9,4.98,474.39
talker who stirred up the people,474.78,5.039,477.29949999999997
president Santana would be pleased nah,476.88,4.379,479.0695
not when he hears it the way I'll tell,479.819,3.621,481.6295
what is it you can suggest I do,485.4,6.12,488.46
I'll give you back your agent I do not,488.819,4.921,491.27950000000004

I'll turn him over to the Texans,495.419,3.0,496.919
and that wouldn't be good for you,497.16,2.819,498.5695
in return what must I give to you,499.979,3.861,501.9095
and that is why I thank you for coming,523.68,4.74,526.05
whatever else we determine here tonight,526.8,4.14,528.87
the first order for decision is how we,528.42,5.039,530.9395
shall inhibit Juan Bradburn from sending,530.94,4.019,532.9495000000001
William Travis to the dungeon it won't,533.459,4.101,535.5095
be necessary,534.959,2.601,536.2595
I brought my rescuer with me senior,538.32,3.9,540.2700000000001
Travis what a pleasure to see you free,540.6,4.2,542.7
again it's a new buoy did not know,542.22,5.58,545.01
you're an underwear glad to see you what,544.8,4.44,547.02
is this singer Travis says about his,547.8,3.42,549.51
rescue I still don't know what happened,549.24,4.2,551.34
Bradburn came to me with Jim Bowie and,551.22,4.4,553.4200000000001
said a mistake had been made,553.44,5.339,556.1095
he's a very impetuous man I kind of told,555.62,5.46,558.35
him about myself hello Jim hello,558.779,5.461,561.5095
gentlemen an old friend James Bowie,561.08,4.9,563.5300000000001
one of our biggest landowners and a,564.24,4.02,566.25
friend of all texians,565.98,5.0,568.48
I uh I know most of these men I don't,572.22,3.6,574.02
want to interfere I'll just take a seat,574.26,5.18,576.85
of my man Gentlemen please,575.82,3.62,577.63
to those of you who do not know me well,580.38,3.98,582.37
and who may wonder why I have thrown in,584.399,3.721,586.2595
my lot with you colonists,586.08,3.84,588.0
I would like to say that I have received,588.12,3.0,589.62
deeply troubling reports from my people,591.12,6.12,594.18
my relatives in Mexico,594.24,5.46,596.97
that the president is General Santana is,597.24,5.58,600.03
moving quickly towards despotic powers,599.7,5.52,602.46
and we my people do not wish to return,602.82,5.22,605.4300000000001
to any form of despotism,605.22,4.98,607.71
either here in Texas or in any other,608.04,3.72,609.9
part of Mexico,610.2,4.819,612.6095
and now it's in your Travis,611.76,3.259,613.3895
four months ago this group sent to,619.2,4.319,621.3595
Mexico City our good friend Mr Stephen,621.6,3.12,623.16
where the petition stating our requests,624.72,6.119,627.7795
for certain governmental reforms,627.36,6.0,630.36
Mr Austin was shortly thrown into a,630.839,5.161,633.4195000000001
military prison for they say writing a,633.36,4.919,635.8195000000001
letter advising us that only the,636.0,4.26,638.13
strongest measures could secure justice,638.279,4.201,640.3795
under Santa Ana,640.26,4.44,642.48
I for one agree wholeheartedly with the,642.48,4.56,644.76
sentiments of Mr Austin who is still,644.7,4.92,647.1600000000001
rotting in a dungeon in Mexico City I,647.04,4.799,649.4395
say to you now that the only course left,649.62,4.32,651.78
open to us is to show the military,651.839,4.44,654.0590000000001
authorities that we will not passively,653.94,4.92,656.4000000000001
submit to Injustice I say to you it's,656.279,4.68,658.619
time for us to stand on our feet,658.86,4.44,661.08
to demand what is our right,660.959,4.5,663.209
to take whatever steps are necessary to,663.3,4.32,665.4599999999999
make those demands felt to create a,665.459,6.081,668.4994999999999
militia if need be to fight if we must,667.62,3.92,669.58
I have the feeling you don't agree with,679.8,3.24,681.42
senior Travis we have identical,683.04,3.299,684.6895
but I am Mexicana of pure Spanish,686.339,3.481,688.0795
and I know the temper of my people,689.82,5.3,692.47
their pride,692.279,2.841,693.6995
their very deep Pride,696.18,5.159,698.7595
and though I am fearful of Santa Ana's,699.3,3.36,700.9799999999999
I could never counsel the people of,702.66,3.239,704.2795
Texas to take any action which would,704.279,3.0,705.779
cause a break in the Friendship of the,705.899,3.661,707.7295
Mexican people themselves,707.279,3.721,709.1395
there are thousands of miles that,709.56,3.719,711.4195
separate us and we have not yet certain,711.0,4.8,713.4
proof that the president sadhana has,713.279,3.661,715.1095
become everything his political,715.8,4.099,717.8494999999999
opponents say he has,716.94,2.959,718.4195000000001
if you ask my opinion I would say let us,720.66,4.14,722.73
but with care,724.8,4.44,727.02
with caution,727.44,5.36,730.12
I quite agree with you senor,729.24,3.56,731.02
I'd like to hear from Mr Bowie,733.079,5.161,735.6595
I don't think I have anything to say I,735.66,4.38,737.85
just came to listen,738.24,3.3,739.89
it appears I don't have your confidence,740.04,2.76,741.42
isn't Mr Bowie a Mexican citizen,744.6,6.66,747.9300000000001
that's right I'm married to a lovely,749.04,3.84,750.9599999999999
Spanish lady,751.26,3.54,753.03
as the senores told you I've acquired a,752.88,3.54,754.65
few acres of land,754.8,4.62,757.1099999999999
I've even fought alongside the Mexicans,756.42,4.62,758.7299999999999
my wife and I have a lovely home in,759.42,2.58,760.7099999999999
I'm on my way there now,762.0,6.68,765.34
I'm sorry am I interrupting,764.88,3.8,766.78
I think my dear you are just in time,769.079,5.06,771.6089999999999
gentlemen I have the honor my niece,771.959,5.781,774.8494999999999
senorita de quesada,774.139,3.601,775.9395000000001
my pleasure senorita,782.459,3.081,783.9994999999999
bill is for me I'm inclined to agree,789.24,4.74,791.61
I think it's necessary for every man,793.98,4.5,796.23
here to save where he stands,795.6,6.299,798.7495
forgive me Mr Bowie if I insist,798.48,5.46,801.21
I don't have any exact stand yet Mr,801.899,4.921,804.3595
Travis don't know enough about it,803.94,5.339,806.6095
just on my way home to mon Clover call,806.82,3.54,808.59
to see my wife and children,811.98,3.72,813.84
figure out learn a little more about it,814.019,4.5,816.269
as time goes on from your father-in-law,815.7,5.72,818.5600000000001
the lieutenant governor of coila Mexico,818.519,6.081,821.5595
that's right,821.42,3.18,823.01
it seems strange to me that the two men,825.24,4.08,827.28
with the most to lose in the event of,827.579,3.481,829.3195
with the most to gain from Santa Anna's,831.06,3.36,832.7399999999999
friendship,833.279,3.06,834.809
the two men with the largest land,834.42,4.44,836.64
Holdings in Texas and Mexico,836.339,4.861,838.7695000000001
these are the two men that urge caution,838.86,5.34,841.53
my apologies to you Senor to Casada,851.16,4.44,853.38
I excuse the young lawyer what I've seen,855.6,3.96,857.58
most lawyers have the notion they can,858.24,3.48,859.98
say anything they like get used to it in,859.56,5.0,862.06
the courtroom I expect,861.72,2.84,863.14
the trouble with you Travis is that you,864.72,3.84,866.64
haven't lived long enough or had enough,867.0,2.76,868.38
experience to know what you're talking,868.56,2.16,869.64
had I known this before I'm not so sure,870.72,4.34,872.89
you'd be here now,872.279,2.781,873.6695
in the interest of what you're trying to,878.88,3.06,880.41
accomplish I'll remove some of the young,880.44,3.6,882.24
lawyer's difficulty,881.94,3.97,883.9250000000001
buenas noches,884.04,14.65,891.365
you shouldn't be out here alone I'm not,914.82,4.86,917.25
Senora Maria is here,917.22,5.64,920.0400000000001
well don't be frightened,922.86,3.12,924.42
no but I have to tell you,925.98,4.62,928.29
many of the men stayed late,927.779,5.101,930.3295
I went to my room but I couldn't sleep,930.6,4.08,932.64
the entrance of the house is next to my,932.88,3.36,934.56
two men stop to speak,936.24,3.959,938.2195
they are your enemy senor,938.04,3.84,939.9599999999999
they were talking that it would be well,940.199,4.561,942.4794999999999
if you didn't go to Monclova,941.88,4.86,944.31
you know who they worse and your boy but,944.76,3.36,946.4399999999999
they said they were coming to the end to,946.74,3.12,948.3
but not Travis,949.86,5.339,952.5295
I would have known his voice,952.26,5.66,955.09
did you hear anything else,955.199,2.721,956.5595
I told you,960.959,3.961,962.9395
thank you senorita,962.699,3.841,964.6194999999999
it's time for you to go you don't,964.92,3.84,966.8399999999999
remember me,966.54,4.799,968.9395
San Antonio,971.339,3.781,973.2295
oh I haven't been in San Antonio for,973.38,3.18,974.97
almost a year,975.12,3.959,977.0995
I've seen you many times,979.079,5.88,982.019
once I met your wife she's very,981.42,6.599,984.7194999999999
very good thank you cheers may I ask,984.959,6.18,988.049
yeah why did you allow my uncle and,988.019,6.0,991.019
yourself to be insulted,991.139,7.161,994.7195
thought no one talked so to Senor point,994.019,4.281,996.1595
I should have killed him,998.339,3.68,1000.1790000000001
how old are you,1006.019,5.601,1008.8195000000001
when I was 17 I thought I knew,1016.18,3.519,1017.9395
everything,1018.5,4.38,1020.69
it's not so simple now,1019.699,6.181,1022.7895
please don't laugh at me,1022.88,5.699,1025.7295
no man is ever going to laugh at you,1025.88,5.52,1028.64
they'll smile a little perhaps,1028.579,4.62,1030.889
with Wonder,1031.4,4.62,1033.71
they won't laugh,1033.199,4.74,1035.569
what is your name,1036.02,5.819,1038.9295
Consuelo Consuela,1037.939,3.9,1039.8890000000001
Consuelo remember this,1042.799,3.9,1044.749
at insult is something that happens when,1046.699,4.321,1048.8595
men become aroused,1048.5,4.559,1050.7795
and one of them can't stop he boils over,1051.02,4.86,1053.45
and the words come spilling out,1053.059,5.101,1055.6095
so you kill him,1055.88,4.62,1058.19
and you walk outside for a few minutes,1058.16,5.24,1060.78
maybe you feel good,1060.5,2.9,1061.95
then you look up at the stars,1063.5,4.32,1065.66
out across at the Horizon with the dawn,1065.539,4.741,1067.9095
suddenly you realize that it's a big,1070.28,3.54,1072.05
and that nothing has changed,1073.82,4.44,1076.04
somewhere there's a woman without a man,1076.64,4.38,1078.8300000000002
and maybe children without a father all,1078.26,6.14,1081.33
because of a few hot words,1081.02,3.38,1082.71
does that make sense to you,1084.98,3.079,1086.5195
I don't know,1089.24,2.72,1090.6
I never thought,1092.72,3.06,1094.25
you'd say this,1094.4,4.7,1096.75
I didn't think I would either,1095.78,3.32,1097.44

about it with my nose in the dust of the,1294.02,3.84,1295.94
road was it your order to shoot my horse,1296.0,4.08,1298.04
and bring me here by force who did this,1297.86,4.92,1300.32
to you that idiot officer of yours it is,1300.08,5.579,1302.8695
through I am served by fools,1302.78,4.8,1305.18

come sit down,1319.78,3.48,1321.52
only the very best for my friend boy,1328.34,6.78,1331.73
vintage of 1817.,1331.159,3.961,1333.1395
you have served with me and how many,1336.74,4.26,1338.8700000000001
campaigns you have been my,1338.36,5.699,1341.2095
how is it now you question me,1341.0,5.039,1343.5195
a man takes a drink you can usually,1344.059,3.961,1346.0394999999999
smell it on his breath and I have been,1346.039,5.281,1348.6795
taking a drink of what or maybe,1348.02,5.159,1350.5995
smells that way,1353.179,3.781,1355.0695
you are the only man in the world that,1355.34,2.76,1356.72
would allowed to talk to me like this,1356.96,3.78,1358.8500000000001
that's what I mean,1358.1,4.86,1360.53
who are these Texans,1360.74,3.72,1362.6
these colonists who think they can,1362.96,3.06,1364.49
dictate to the government of Mexico and,1364.46,3.36,1366.14
who is this lawyer this Travis who sets,1366.02,4.26,1368.15
himself above the military governor,1367.82,4.5,1370.07
I think Travis and his friends are all,1370.28,3.84,1372.2
threaters they should be stood against,1372.32,4.8,1374.72
the barracks wall and shut,1374.12,4.5,1376.37
your Governor is making a lot of,1377.12,4.38,1379.31
mistakes Redbone he's a fool,1378.62,5.22,1381.2299999999998
well they can't all be fools,1381.5,4.2,1383.6
who's the full responsible for throwing,1383.84,3.3,1385.49
Stephen Austin in jail in Mexico City,1385.7,2.76,1387.0800000000002
and keeping him there,1387.14,4.32,1389.3000000000002
Austin is a conspirator,1388.46,5.579,1391.2495000000001
he came to you with a petition,1391.46,4.8,1393.8600000000001
seems sensible,1394.039,4.02,1396.049
people nowadays just don't take the,1396.26,3.299,1397.9095
one-man rule,1398.059,2.761,1399.4395
at least there are a lot of people back,1399.559,3.901,1401.5095
in Texas who don't,1400.82,5.64,1403.6399999999999
ah I'm not in the habit of offering,1403.46,5.82,1406.3700000000001
advice you have my permission,1406.46,4.98,1408.95
thank you because I have a good deal of,1409.28,3.36,1410.96
respect for you,1411.44,4.26,1413.5700000000002
liking too thank you,1412.64,5.279,1415.2795
I just want to say one thing to you,1415.7,4.5,1417.95
most people are a good deal like I am,1417.919,3.901,1419.8695
and you could never make me follow you,1420.2,4.08,1422.24
by force don't talk to me like a,1421.82,3.9,1423.77
Frontiers man you are an educated man,1424.28,3.06,1425.81
say what you mean,1425.72,3.54,1427.49
the constitutional government,1427.34,5.04,1429.86
return to the constitution of 1824 a,1429.26,4.86,1431.69
complete renunciation of any despotic,1432.38,3.36,1434.0600000000002
appetites you might have Acquired and,1434.12,3.419,1435.8294999999998
released Stephen Austin,1435.74,3.72,1437.6
the Texans will never have any faith in,1437.539,5.061,1440.0695
you as long as you hold him,1439.46,3.14,1441.03
I have only love for my country,1446.179,4.74,1448.549
I think I have demonstrated that many,1449.12,5.939,1452.0894999999998
times possibly I have been misunderstood,1450.919,6.661,1454.2495000000001
but I thank you Jimmy for being frank I,1455.059,4.801,1457.4595
have great admiration for you,1457.58,4.979,1460.0694999999998
I have loved you as a brother,1459.86,4.74,1462.2299999999998
I must be sure you are not against me,1462.559,4.98,1465.049
that I have not turned you,1464.6,5.459,1467.3294999999998
I say in all honesty that you would be a,1467.539,4.26,1469.669
great rallying point for any faction,1470.059,4.561,1472.3395
that gained your support,1471.799,5.221,1474.4095
and I do not wish to see Civil War come,1474.62,4.32,1476.78
we have had too many wars,1478.94,5.52,1481.7
we need peace and prosperity,1481.1,5.819,1484.0095
that is my aim My ultimate aim,1484.46,4.44,1486.68
sounds good,1486.919,4.981,1489.4095000000002
you have revealed much to me I do not,1488.9,5.7,1491.75
wish to be a dictator a tyrant,1491.9,6.899,1495.3495
I want to be a gracious page in history,1494.6,5.88,1497.54
I must consider what you have said I,1498.799,4.561,1501.0795
must reevaluate,1500.48,5.699,1503.3295
I thank you again,1503.36,5.52,1506.12
let us drink to it we Have No Quarter my,1506.179,4.201,1508.2795
to our country and to us,1510.38,5.24,1513.0
in that order,1512.84,2.78,1514.23
don't go yet Jimmy,1522.46,3.599,1524.2595000000001
now I must hurt you,1528.98,3.439,1530.6995
the officer who brought you was obeying,1532.58,3.54,1534.35
my orders to bring you here on the wrong,1534.679,4.141,1536.7495000000001
God if necessary but not for the talk we,1536.12,4.38,1538.31
have just had,1538.82,4.32,1540.98
I thought it would be less painful if,1540.5,4.679,1542.8395
you heard from your friend the worst,1543.14,4.68,1545.48
news when men can bring to another,1545.179,4.801,1547.5795
what are you talking about,1547.82,4.8,1550.22
reality my friend is is that you sent,1549.98,4.799,1552.3795
your family here to avoid the plague in,1552.62,4.4,1554.82
fortunately the plague sometimes travels,1557.179,4.88,1559.6190000000001
when I arrived here I thought to visit,1562.159,4.561,1564.4395000000002
your wife Donna Ursula,1564.44,4.2,1566.54
before I started that word was brought,1566.72,2.939,1568.1895
that you're,1569.659,4.201,1571.7595000000001
you're wife and beautiful children they,1571.34,5.06,1573.87
are no more,1573.86,2.54,1575.1299999999999
I have made the arrangements you would,1577.52,4.58,1579.81
have wished Jimmy,1579.32,2.78,1580.71
oh Jimmy Jimmy I,1582.2,4.979,1584.6895
I cannot tell you how how deeply sorry I,1584.539,4.821,1586.9495
truly he has been my friend but he's a,1618.88,5.56,1621.66
very Sentimental Man perhaps he's going,1622.1,4.8,1624.5
to be involved in Austin,1624.44,4.5,1626.69
have him released perhaps by now he is a,1626.9,3.3,1628.5500000000002
surely and Texas,1630.2,4.92,1632.66
when I've closed the legislatures I,1633.14,3.6,1634.94
wanted well Garrison,1635.12,3.419,1636.8294999999998
and all texians who have arms will,1636.74,3.319,1638.3995
surrender them on the penalty of death,1638.539,4.681,1640.8795
why should Excellency they are becoming,1640.059,5.321,1642.7195
two particular San Antonio this is the,1643.22,4.38,1645.41
key to the whole central region yes and,1645.38,4.44,1647.6000000000001
you will personally got us on it yes my,1647.6,4.459,1649.8294999999998
why are we stopping here,1677.6,4.559,1679.8795
we will Camp here senor,1679.64,6.56,1682.92
and wait for your friends from Anaheim,1682.159,4.041,1684.1795000000002
welcome home Mr Austin it's good to see,1696.86,4.5,1699.11
you sir well it's good to see you too,1699.26,3.62,1701.07
tell me what are you doing around these,1702.88,4.36,1705.0600000000002
oh I I've been wandering around,1707.24,5.46,1709.97
playing a quiet lone game trying to get,1710.48,4.26,1712.6100000000001
a few things straight in my head,1712.7,4.44,1714.92
I end out what you really want to do you,1714.74,4.38,1716.93
ought to try a dungeon,1717.14,4.919,1719.5995
I don't know how you stood it,1719.12,5.4,1721.82
didn't remember how adamant I used to be,1722.059,6.181,1725.1495
but living up to the Mexican law,1724.52,6.24,1727.6399999999999
yes you always said the Texans made a,1728.24,4.319,1730.3995
bargain and they should stick to it yeah,1730.76,3.779,1732.6495
I was always against all that move for,1732.559,4.141,1734.6295
Independence I thought all the leaders,1734.539,3.421,1736.2495
were a bunch of,1736.7,3.959,1738.6795
Hot Heads and troublemakers,1737.96,4.98,1740.45
my eyes have been open,1742.94,3.719,1744.7995
completely,1744.86,3.48,1746.6
I thought Santa Anna would listen to,1746.659,2.88,1748.0990000000002
what kind of a president does he expect,1749.539,4.441,1751.7595
to be throwing me in prison just because,1751.88,5.159,1754.4595000000002
I argued for our cause,1753.98,6.059,1757.0095000000001
perhaps he's a frightened man perhaps he,1757.039,5.101,1759.5895
felt if he kept you quiet and like you,1760.039,4.201,1762.1395
rot in the Dust by all of Texas would be,1762.14,3.419,1763.8495
he misjudged my character,1765.559,5.22,1768.1689999999999
he doesn't know the passion of a man who,1768.62,4.02,1770.6299999999999
wants to be free,1770.779,3.241,1772.3995
should a man live under a tyrant who,1774.02,5.1,1776.57
makes laws filled with inequities in,1776.539,5.52,1779.299
Humanities and injustices,1779.12,5.1,1781.6699999999998
shouldn't a man resist a hand that's,1782.059,5.36,1784.739
choking him to death,1784.22,3.199,1785.8195
what are you going to advise the Texans,1788.24,3.9,1790.19
there are only three courses open to us,1794.179,3.061,1795.7095000000002
wants to give up,1797.24,4.919,1799.6995
leave the country everything we own and,1799.94,4.5,1802.19
have done there,1802.159,5.101,1804.7095000000002
the Texans would never do that,1804.44,6.18,1807.53
and then there's the passive attitude,1807.26,7.2,1810.86
take whatever Santa Anna She's Fit to,1810.62,4.86,1813.05
they wouldn't do that either,1815.48,5.28,1818.1200000000001
The Last Choice you know,1820.76,3.62,1822.57
I guess I found what I was looking for,1828.5,3.74,1830.37
I'll say goodbye sir,1832.94,4.5,1835.19
my friends from anahec will be coming,1835.34,4.62,1837.6499999999999
shortly to see me why don't you stay Jim,1837.44,3.719,1839.2995
thank you I'd like to but for a while I,1841.159,4.691,1843.5045
prefer to play it alone,1843.62,26.399,1856.8194999999998
here they come,1876.76,20.999,1887.2595

you are a welcome sight sir,1915.74,3.78,1917.63

I can still talk not much else,1941.299,4.1,1943.349
I'm afraid I have bad news yes,1948.26,7.1,1951.81
my mission of course was hopeless,1951.679,3.681,1953.5195
I've come to the conclusion there's only,1956.24,4.38,1958.43
one course open to us any other course,1958.7,3.9,1960.65
would be fruitless,1960.62,6.08,1963.6599999999999
and only be postponing the inevitable,1962.6,4.1,1964.6499999999999
we must load our guns and assert our,1966.919,4.62,1969.229
we formed a committee we want you to hit,1971.539,3.721,1973.3995

I didn't get that impression of Jim at,1992.84,5.3,1995.49
all matter of fact that,1994.58,3.56,1996.36
two things should not be done at once,2022.179,5.161,2024.7595000000001

Jeb you're very nice,2065.139,6.48,2068.379
I've always thought what,2068.099,4.601,2070.3995
you wouldn't like me to say it what did,2072.7,4.679,2075.0395
you come to tell me Mr Austin said he'd,2075.04,5.16,2077.62

say he went to join General Houston,2893.319,5.401,2896.0195
others say he returned to Mexico nobody,2895.599,5.701,2898.4495
couldn't have gone back to Mexico now,2898.72,4.859,2901.1495
of course not senorita,2901.3,5.819,2904.2095000000004
you do not believe that Venezuela these,2903.579,5.341,2906.2495000000004
questions are hardly necessary,2907.119,3.48,2908.859

with your uncle because you do not,2913.06,4.44,2915.2799999999997
understand a man like senior pool,2914.74,4.44,2916.9599999999996
you do not understand that when people,2917.5,4.44,2919.72
are troubled as many of us are,2919.18,4.5,2921.43
it is not always easy to know what is,2921.94,3.12,2923.5
Senor boy is a very great man,2925.06,4.44,2927.2799999999997

Ambush you put on thank you,3061.44,5.1,3063.9900000000002
tends to prove what I've maintained all,3064.619,4.621,3066.9295
along a little show of force,3066.54,5.279,3069.1795
general cost that easy well by no means,3069.24,4.2,3071.3399999999997
I understand the Mexicans are excellent,3071.819,3.601,3073.6195
Fighters but in my opinion it was the,3073.44,3.419,3075.1495
element of surprise that turned the,3075.42,2.82,3076.83
surprised me too and the point remains,3078.24,4.5,3080.49
that General cause is gone and under,3080.579,3.78,3082.469
parole never to bear arms against us,3082.74,4.8,3085.14
again maybe he won't and that is the end,3084.359,5.161,3086.9395
of their military rule,3087.54,4.68,3089.88
Colonel I have been talking around the,3089.52,4.92,3091.98
town most of your men seem to be agreed,3092.22,4.859,3094.6495
on one thing what's that going home,3094.44,4.44,3096.66
those who haven't already left are,3097.079,4.921,3099.5395000000003
talking about it you have a force of 104,3098.88,5.64,3101.7000000000003
men plus my 24 volunteers and no,3102.0,4.559,3104.2795
surprise left in the barrel,3104.52,3.539,3106.2895
when we first met you uh argued against,3108.059,5.341,3110.7295000000004
us then you swung around our side you,3110.7,4.859,3113.1295
put on a great fight but now you seem to,3113.4,3.9,3115.35
be singing that same old song again,3115.559,4.441,3117.7795
caution caution caution am I we've,3117.3,4.38,3119.4900000000002
plenty of Men available,3120.0,4.559,3122.2795
Colonel fanninson Goliad Davy Crockett's,3121.68,4.26,3123.81
coming into Texas at the head of a,3124.559,3.721,3126.4195
thousand men General Houston is forming,3125.94,4.26,3128.07
an army if they're needed I'm afraid it,3128.28,3.6,3130.0800000000004
isn't going to be that simple I just,3130.2,3.78,3132.0899999999997
left General Houston he hasn't any army,3131.88,3.239,3133.4995
it appeared to both of us that an army,3135.119,3.48,3136.859
that isn't is about to engage an army,3136.92,3.98,3138.91
Mr Bowie I cannot reconcile your,3141.24,3.96,3143.22
shifting positions,3143.64,3.36,3145.3199999999997
was that General Houston's opinion or,3145.2,4.2,3147.2999999999997
was it yours just how many sides are you,3147.0,4.579,3149.2895
I beg you Senor boy,3152.64,7.219,3156.2495
do you think it makes much sense,3156.0,3.859,3157.9295
please may I speak with you,3164.94,3.8,3166.84
that's your pleasure Mr Bowie,3169.98,3.56,3171.76
Lieutenant unless you and I talked some,3178.22,4.18,3180.31
I want to apologize,3182.4,3.08,3183.94
something I had to drive out of my mind,3185.96,7.18,3189.55
did you yes I think so,3188.54,7.14,3192.11
let me look at you,3193.14,7.26,3196.77
I'm the same I'm not tall or older hey,3195.68,8.08,3199.72
you Senora I'm 19.,3200.4,6.08,3203.44
I heard Senor you did not meet you,3208.559,4.981,3211.0495
no not in time,3213.54,3.68,3215.38
that's better you get it over with it,3221.64,4.4,3223.8399999999997
you gave me quite a start just now,3227.22,5.16,3229.7999999999997
it sounded just like her,3230.16,7.08,3233.7
same tone in your voice same softness,3232.38,7.32,3236.04
it's like standing behind yourself,3237.24,5.599,3240.0395
something that had happened before,3239.7,3.139,3241.2695
I remember we were at a party dancing,3243.3,5.819,3246.2095000000004
man tried to cut in I didn't want him to,3246.839,4.941,3249.3095
I called him out,3249.119,2.661,3250.4495
and she put her hand in my arm and said,3252.0,6.2,3255.1

commander-in-chief of the armies of the,4123.88,3.819,4125.7895

I came out here under a flag of truce,4316.46,7.04,4319.9800000000005
I'll go back the same way,4320.0,3.5,4321.75
and tell your people they were,4326.719,3.121,4328.2795
surrendered by discretion otherwise my,4328.159,3.241,4329.7795
dear brother I will be obliged to give,4329.84,4.62,4332.150000000001
my bugler the order to blow the deguel,4331.4,5.88,4334.339999999999
no what that means,4334.46,4.8,4336.86
we have women and children you'll give,4337.28,4.5,4339.53
them safe conduct naturally,4339.26,4.56,4341.54
adios company,4341.78,2.71,4343.134999999999
surrender at his discretion or the,4364.9,5.799,4367.7995
deguelo the what they run up a red flag,4367.76,5.64,4370.58
and they sound like a Guero on the bugle,4370.699,4.861,4373.1295
it means no quarter no mercy in other,4373.4,3.9,4375.349999999999
words no prisoners,4375.56,4.74,4377.93
my stars and possum dogs that Santa Anna,4377.3,5.64,4380.12
scares me Plum out of my britches what,4380.3,4.859,4382.7295
does he expects us to do just come out,4382.94,4.32,4385.099999999999
there and surrender,4385.159,4.02,4387.169
I want to be pretty when it grows,4389.179,3.801,4391.0795
you sing real pretty don't they,4413.54,4.38,4415.73
yes but they got us completely,4416.0,5.84,4418.92
surrounded so keep your eyes open,4417.92,3.92,4419.88
I understand you'll provide us with a,4423.38,4.38,4425.57
suitable escort kernel but every man,4425.48,3.9,4427.429999999999
here will be needed,4427.76,3.899,4429.7095
I'd like to do as you request but Mrs,4429.38,4.799,4431.779500000001
Dickinson you don't understand it's not,4431.659,5.221,4434.269499999999
a request it's an order,4434.179,5.221,4436.7895
no Colonel I can't be ordered,4439.4,5.16,4441.98
I've sought the protection of the foot,4443.0,3.12,4444.56
and I have it,4444.56,3.42,4446.27
I don't believe General Santana will,4446.12,4.079,4448.1595
harm women and children,4447.98,4.44,4450.2
as long as my husband stays I'll remain,4450.199,4.581,4452.4895
there's lieutenant,4456.26,4.32,4458.42
I'm sorry colonel,4457.699,4.561,4459.9794999999995
my wife has the right to make her own,4460.58,3.599,4462.3795
apparently she's made it,4464.179,3.141,4465.7495
at least I can count on you to see that,4472.82,4.82,4475.23
the senorita leaves,4474.62,3.02,4476.13
I am sorry,4480.38,5.66,4483.21
I would prefer to have her go,4482.54,3.5,4484.29
but if Mrs Dickinson is staying,4486.08,7.4,4489.78
it is necessary that Consuelo stays,4489.38,4.1,4491.43
thank you colonel,4499.4,4.5,4501.65
if you'll excuse me I must attend to my,4501.739,4.341,4503.9095
how about sending out a Detachment you,4527.02,5.74,4529.89
think we can afford to lose them no,4529.64,5.34,4532.31
no you're right of course we can what do,4532.76,3.899,4534.7095
you think Jim,4534.98,3.84,4536.9
all right maybe make a good diversion,4536.659,5.901,4539.6095
help get a rider out to Fannin,4538.82,3.74,4540.69
ready to go all ready to go,4705.26,13.219,4711.8695
gym you've got to make it if anybody at,4751.96,4.22,4754.07
all can get through I will,4754.76,18.59,4764.055
get it inside,4835.48,9.899,4840.429499999999
how is he bad right side of his chest,4860.96,5.94,4863.93
smashed doc thinks he can patch him up,4864.199,3.901,4866.1494999999995
he's optimistic,4868.1,4.26,4870.2300000000005
you know we didn't want to tell the rest,4870.679,4.801,4873.0795
of the men how bad it was,4872.36,4.799,4874.7595
we're needing,4875.48,5.16,4878.0599999999995
I need the idea of him do you agree,4877.159,5.401,4879.8595
of course I agree,4880.64,3.36,4882.320000000001
he's the one man here who's not,4882.56,3.92,4884.52
replaceable,4884.0,5.9,4886.95
at it again,4886.48,3.42,4888.19
you said once you could lick me,4905.9,3.62,4907.71
you're good now,4910.34,5.96,4913.32
I wouldn't want to Jim,4913.04,3.26,4914.67
you're still a good man,4917.12,3.14,4918.69
you all right corner,4929.84,3.72,4931.7
I was over there,4933.56,3.08,4935.1
what are they waiting for,4936.86,3.02,4938.37
three days pandemonium then three days,4940.159,3.361,4941.8395
quiet and then the whole thing all over,4942.08,2.7,4943.43
wears down,4944.78,4.32,4946.94
if he can break us he'll,4947.06,4.5,4949.31
have an army intact,4949.1,5.66,4951.93
march across Texas,4951.56,3.2,4953.160000000001
every day does give Houston more time,4955.159,6.361,4958.3395
Santa and I won't wait long,4958.94,6.799,4962.3395
he might be sending for heavier Cannon,4961.52,4.219,4963.6295
I'd be pleased if you'd assume complete,4969.62,4.579,4971.9095
I've been meaning to say I,4980.96,4.739,4983.3295
I should have said it before,4983.48,5.46,4986.209999999999
I consider it an honor serving unto you,4985.699,5.781,4988.5895
you mind if I say that,4992.78,5.52,4995.54
it's been interesting watching you grow,4995.12,7.039,4998.6395
you're a pretty tall man now well,4998.3,3.859,5000.2295
I never seen,5002.44,2.9,5003.889999999999
what's the answer,5008.38,2.6,5009.68
Houston's in the north gym recruiting,5011.8,5.16,5014.38
is they told me he didn't have a force,5015.28,4.2,5017.38
fit to sin,5016.96,6.68,5020.3
all right take care of yourself,5019.48,4.16,5021.5599999999995
but fannin's coming,5029.5,4.679,5031.8395
perhaps he could be able to get through,5031.42,4.259,5033.5495
and that'll be just tries to walk in be,5035.679,4.081,5037.7195
cut to pieces,5038.32,5.04,5040.84
if he waits till Santa Ana attacks,5039.76,6.78,5043.150000000001
maybe I'll go back now give me in give,5043.36,5.78,5046.25
me a hand Lee,5046.54,2.6,5047.84
I can make no Jim let me help you now,5055.12,6.5,5058.37
no need them seeing,5058.48,3.14,5060.049999999999
don't know each other very well do we,5079.96,7.86,5083.89
I know I understand the customer,5083.8,6.84,5087.22
ordinarily to be different,5087.82,5.16,5090.4
the way things are the time seems to,5092.98,4.82,5095.389999999999
have gotten all pushed together,5094.659,3.141,5096.2294999999995
I I thought you might let me speak to,5098.62,3.66,5100.45
your uncle,5101.32,3.78,5103.21
Jeff I've been unfair,5102.28,5.22,5104.889999999999
I like you so much I'd like to be with,5105.1,3.3,5106.75
we can laugh together,5108.4,5.54,5111.17
at least we could,5110.98,2.96,5112.459999999999
and I know,5114.159,4.621,5116.469499999999
I could see it when you looked at me,5116.679,4.98,5119.169
I didn't think it would last,5118.78,5.1,5121.33
it's my fault Jeff,5121.659,5.781,5124.5495
I didn't want to hurt you,5123.88,3.56,5125.66
I couldn't bring myself,5127.719,3.201,5129.3195
and now I have heard you,5131.62,6.119,5134.6795
you couldn't hurt me Consuela,5134.98,4.98,5137.469999999999
I just feel empty,5139.96,3.259,5141.5895
did you get through,5168.06,5.98,5171.05
I got through all right but fannin's not,5171.4,4.819,5173.809499999999
Jim will you get off your feet,5202.42,4.799,5204.8195000000005
Phantom isn't coming,5205.48,3.179,5207.0695
we started his equipment broke down,5209.679,3.721,5211.5395
Advanced guard was taking my Mexican,5211.54,5.3,5214.19
patrols he's unable to move,5213.4,3.44,5215.12
what's Travis gonna do he's calling all,5217.78,4.08,5219.82
the men together he's putting it up to,5220.3,3.68,5222.14
walk me out with him I shouldn't Jim now,5225.52,5.1,5228.070000000001
I'd started to rain,5228.159,5.241,5230.7795
a lot different,5230.62,2.78,5232.01
we have no more hope for reinforcement,5271.98,6.64,5275.299999999999
Colonel Fannin can't reach it,5275.26,5.58,5278.05
no doubt at this moment Santa Ana is,5278.62,4.98,5281.11
mounting an assault in force,5280.84,4.92,5283.3
the outcome of that assault you can,5283.6,3.72,5285.46
easily guess,5285.76,5.52,5288.52
they outnumber us Thirty to one,5287.32,7.02,5290.83
the three courses open to you,5291.28,4.56,5293.5599999999995
you can try and fight your way out,5294.34,3.78,5296.2300000000005
through their cavalry,5295.84,3.899,5297.7895
probably been cut to Pieces before,5298.12,4.32,5300.28
you've gone a mile,5299.739,6.621,5303.049499999999
their second choice is to surrender,5302.44,3.92,5304.4
anyone may do so who chooses to you have,5307.36,5.22,5309.969999999999
my permission but remember,5310.06,5.28,5312.700000000001
that when you surrendered you free an,5312.58,5.099,5315.1295
army of thousands of men to make war on,5315.34,3.78,5317.2300000000005
the rest of Texas,5317.679,3.901,5319.6295
the third alternative is to stay here,5319.12,4.2,5321.22
we can kill them as they charge us kill,5323.32,4.26,5325.45
them as they scale our walls kill them,5325.78,4.26,5327.91
as they put the bayonet to us oh we'll,5327.58,4.38,5329.7699999999995
all die have no doubt of that the,5330.04,3.96,5332.0199999999995
deguelo will be sounded,5331.96,4.739,5334.3295
but what we do here can so disorganize,5334.0,5.46,5336.73
Santa Ana that he won't be able to march,5336.699,5.96,5339.678999999999
for weeks on Sam Houston,5339.46,3.199,5341.0595
I've drawn a line in the dirt,5346.12,5.64,5348.94
any of you who care to stay with us,5348.82,6.319,5351.9794999999995
please step over that line,5351.76,3.379,5353.449500000001
thank you man,5370.96,2.719,5372.3195
do you have anything to say,5376.48,3.14,5378.049999999999
well kind sir we're here doing what we,5381.88,5.58,5384.67
think is right,5386.199,3.901,5388.1494999999995
give us a little encourage but if you,5387.46,6.13,5390.525
please her amen,5390.1,27.92,5404.06
I want that to go out Jim afraid it's,5418.02,3.699,5419.869500000001
going to be the last chance,5420.4,3.18,5421.99
I've written to Sam Houston told him,5423.58,4.02,5425.59
about the decision of the men I think,5425.5,3.659,5427.3295
that's something other Texans want to,5427.6,3.599,5429.3995
know about,5429.159,3.601,5430.9595
Scots report they're building ladders,5431.199,3.901,5433.1494999999995
scaling ladders it was an all-night,5432.76,5.34,5435.43
conference in Santa Ana's 10.,5435.1,5.16,5437.68
talk in the morning probably,5438.1,5.039,5440.619500000001

in the morning but sir in the morning,5504.82,3.78,5506.71
after the first battle there should be,5506.92,4.4,5509.12
lots of rideless horses,5508.6,5.579,5511.3895
wait until you can get one,5511.32,4.96,5513.799999999999

I have news,6174.42,5.06,6176.95
tragic news,6176.639,2.841,6178.0595
a terrible battle has ended at the Alamo,6179.76,6.12,6182.820000000001
we all have lost friends,6183.48,5.28,6186.12
Brave dear friends,6185.88,5.7,6188.7300000000005
Jim Bowie is gone,6188.76,4.62,6191.070000000001
Bill Travis,6191.58,3.599,6193.3795
Davy Crockett,6193.38,4.16,6195.46
doc Summerfield,6195.179,5.52,6197.939
many many more,6197.54,7.56,6201.32
to a man they all died at their posts,6200.699,4.401,6202.8994999999995
theirs was not a defeat,6205.38,5.04,6207.900000000001
you must understand and believe that,6207.48,6.06,6210.509999999999
Santa Ana's strength has been weakened,6210.42,5.219,6213.0295
those who spent their lives bought his,6213.54,3.54,6215.31
to conquer him,6217.08,4.02,6219.09
with an army that will avenge what has,6219.6,3.18,6221.1900000000005
happened there in that small village on,6221.1,4.559,6223.3795
the banks of the silent Hall,6222.78,4.68,6225.12
their fight will be remembered down,6225.659,4.641,6227.9794999999995

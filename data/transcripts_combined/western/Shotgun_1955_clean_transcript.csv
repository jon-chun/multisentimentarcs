what do you want here anyway,289.68,3.9,291.63

sit on over there by your wife and relax,293.58,3.86,295.51

you want there's a couple of Marshals in,313.56,3.72,315.42
clay Hardin and Mark Fletcher,317.28,3.8,319.17999999999995
six years in a stinking prison hole on,325.38,4.86,327.81
account of them,327.66,6.379,330.84950000000003
I figured even things,330.24,3.799,332.1395
tremendous trying to set up an ambush,334.139,3.12,335.699
Thompson you're sure not being very,335.88,4.02,337.89
careful about it somebody's bound to see,337.259,4.5,339.509
you in here that means Harden and,339.9,3.96,341.88
Fletcher will soon be showing up,341.759,4.201,343.8595
that's the point I'm counting on them,343.86,3.72,345.72
thinking this is going to be a real easy,345.96,3.36,347.64
they might try to take me without a,349.32,3.98,351.31
looks like he's catching up on some of,366.78,3.54,368.54999999999995
his sleep the hard way,368.4,4.44,370.62
what about the street how does it look,370.32,4.439,372.5395
just like you figured shouldn't be long,372.84,4.16,374.91999999999996
what are you going to do to us well now,389.88,4.49,392.125
that depends doesn't it,392.58,24.42,404.78999999999996
it's him all right Marshall Ben Thompson,417.0,3.539,418.7695
I saw him to the window he's got a gun,418.919,4.821,421.3295
on Holly and his wife in the bar,420.539,3.201,422.1395
all right Davey you're going home we'll,425.28,4.34,427.45
take care of it,426.96,2.66,428.28999999999996
he won't need that clay you're not going,430.74,4.2,432.84000000000003
I told you I want Thompson alive and,432.479,4.261,434.60949999999997
once he sees you he's sure to start,434.94,3.539,436.7095
that's not the real reason Mark now is,438.479,4.081,440.5195
you got a good job waiting for you up at,442.56,3.479,444.2995
the Capitol and I'm not going to let you,444.479,4.321,446.6395
risk your neck now even if you want to,446.039,4.56,448.31899999999996
well maybe that white collared job,448.8,3.959,450.7795
doesn't seem so important right now,450.599,3.841,452.5195
look you said yourself I'd have a better,452.759,3.121,454.3195
chance taking him alone so let's forget,454.44,3.42,456.15
that was before he was holed up in the,457.86,4.2,459.96000000000004
bar you can't take him now not a fight I,459.36,4.32,461.52000000000004
intend to be there when it starts not,462.06,3.84,463.98
this trip clay I can't take a chance on,463.68,3.78,465.57
Thompson getting nervous and gun and,465.9,4.22,468.01
Holly and his wife,467.46,2.66,468.78999999999996
you don't know Thompson like I do he's,472.979,3.78,474.86899999999997
sure to have at least one Gunslinger,475.08,3.179,476.66949999999997
with him like he pulled on me that time,476.759,3.78,478.649
in Santa Fe you aren't going to be able,478.259,3.72,480.119
to handle them both,480.539,2.761,481.91949999999997
you cover the Corral if anybody's with,483.3,3.42,485.01
Thompson the chances are they'll be,485.46,2.639,486.7795
trying to pick up some fresh horses and,486.72,2.94,488.19000000000005
you can stop him there,488.099,3.0,489.599
but stay off the street I don't want to,489.66,4.64,491.98
fight unless it has to be that way,491.099,3.201,492.6995
he got Fletcher,655.079,5.23,657.694
you're better not to look like,674.839,3.901,676.7895000000001
he was my friend,679.5,2.899,680.9495
was nothing I could do that shotgun just,687.0,6.019,690.0095
practically tore him apart,689.94,3.079,691.4795
where's Johnny,731.579,4.341,733.7494999999999
what happened and we nailed Fletcher we,737.94,5.579,740.7295
never got a chance at harden,741.18,4.56,743.4599999999999
Johnny got it on the way out yeah,743.519,4.201,745.6195
everything turned out just great,745.74,3.36,747.42
I think we should have hung around and,747.72,3.299,749.3695
got hardened is that it,749.1,3.78,750.99
we had chances are we wouldn't be here,751.019,4.021,753.0295
right now what's the difference the way,752.88,3.6,754.68
things stand now with Fletcher dad,755.04,2.76,756.42
Horton's going to be telling us all the,756.48,3.18,758.07
way to Boot Hill and back on the way I,757.8,3.84,759.7199999999999
got it figured,759.66,3.72,761.52
when I was buying those Winchesters in,761.64,2.999,763.1395
Tucson I heard a lot of talk about,763.38,3.6,765.18
Hardin word in the capital is he's going,764.639,4.741,767.0095
to be the new Indian commissioner,766.98,3.9,768.9300000000001
I think he's going to throw over a soft,769.38,3.6,771.18
job like that to come after us I don't,770.88,4.38,773.07
plan on staying around to find out if we,772.98,3.599,774.7795
had any sense we'd be on our way to,775.26,3.98,777.25
California tonight,776.579,2.661,777.9095
we'll clear out for California when this,781.139,3.421,782.8495
we got a good thing worked out with,784.56,3.779,786.4495
Delgado and his Apaches,785.82,3.84,787.74
they're going to pay plenty for those,788.339,3.541,790.1095
new Winchester's but if you're worried,789.66,4.14,791.73
about anything you want to pull out,791.88,5.06,794.41
there's no ropes on you,793.8,3.14,795.37
well maybe I'll do just that,800.519,3.56,802.299
no hard feelings,805.86,3.14,807.4300000000001
no hard feelings,809.1,3.02,810.61
he's getting way out of line then how,819.779,4.201,821.8795
come you let him walk all over you we'll,822.0,4.88,824.44
be moving out soon,823.98,2.9,825.4300000000001
when you know you're gonna have to kill,827.88,2.88,829.32
a man Perez,829.079,5.0,831.579
cost nothing to be polite,830.76,3.319,832.4195
then you won't change your mind,855.2,4.3,857.35
you're a fool clay I Was a Fool to let,859.5,4.86,861.93
Mark Fletcher walk down that street,862.92,3.359,864.5994999999999
alone if that's what you mean you know,864.36,4.44,866.58
perfectly well what I mean Fletcher was,866.279,4.68,868.619
killed doing exactly what he was paid,868.8,4.7,871.15
how can you,870.959,2.541,872.2294999999999
as long as Ben Thompson is running loose,873.959,4.62,876.2689999999999
I can't feel any other way,876.24,5.159,878.8195000000001
or won't either one it adds up the same,878.579,5.88,881.519
not to me father and I have pulled a lot,881.399,4.56,883.679
of strings in the capital arranging for,884.459,2.94,885.929
the kind of job you said you wanted,885.959,3.901,887.9095
which means living life decent people,887.399,4.021,889.4095
and not Savages,889.86,4.62,892.17
and now you're going to walk out on it,891.42,4.979,893.9095
maybe I'm doing you a favor only then,894.48,3.61,896.285
you don't even know it,896.399,2.88,897.839
it doesn't have to be this way clay you,899.279,4.321,901.4395

Thompson why for all we know some of the,903.6,5.16,906.1800000000001
Marshall may have already caught him he,906.6,3.84,908.52
may even be dead by now,908.76,3.0,910.26
when I find out we'll talk about it then,911.76,3.72,913.62
I don't know how I could have ever,913.92,3.659,915.7495

one way or another,924.899,2.901,926.3495

through me you're barking up the wrong,2344.44,4.98,2346.93
tree he ran into me yesterday,2346.3,6.36,2349.48
but a man named Bentley Bentley where,2349.42,4.8,2351.82
he's wanted,2352.66,3.9,2354.6099999999997
that's what I found out yesterday where,2354.22,4.139,2356.2895
floating down the river last I saw face,2358.359,4.321,2360.5195
one thousand dollars,2362.68,5.159,2365.2594999999997
did he mention Perez or Graybar Ben,2364.96,4.32,2367.12
maybe he did and then again maybe he,2369.28,4.2,2371.38
or maybe he told Harden,2373.48,6.44,2376.7
Ed Abby hurry it up,2375.64,4.28,2377.7799999999997
and you hear it,2396.18,3.6,2397.98
acts like an Apache,2434.859,5.301,2437.5095
no I'll let him come in,2437.02,3.14,2438.59
most likely one of delgadito's men,2440.2,4.04,2442.22
who bring word from delgadito,2449.859,4.201,2451.9595
I bring them in you had a star to the,2452.079,2.881,2453.5195000000003
but he did not die that way,2454.96,3.74,2456.83
man called Harden killed him at Yellow,2473.5,4.579,2475.7895
he is now following your Trail,2479.68,3.74,2481.5499999999997

I've been on Plenty of gunfights for,2537.76,3.839,2539.6795
foreign Hours come out on top I don't,2539.5,3.3,2541.15

change anything,2542.8,4.02,2544.8100000000004
knowing Hardin I figure he's going to,2545.079,4.381,2547.2695000000003
head for the Relay station at surveillas,2546.82,4.32,2548.98

to cover our tracks that's a funny thing,2636.099,5.22,2638.7090000000003
I was figuring on doing just that looks,2638.859,4.021,2640.8695
like we're still company,2641.319,4.26,2643.449
we could use an extra gun we've run into,2642.88,5.34,2645.55
plenty of Apache signs it doesn't matter,2645.579,5.821,2648.4895
I'm dropping you off at Savalas tomorrow,2648.22,5.34,2650.89

great to stretch my legs hold it Abby,2726.04,5.16,2728.62

but I'm learning something well that's a,2811.66,3.54,2813.43
they say you can tell a man by the way,2815.2,5.04,2817.72
he treats his horse yeah or his guns,2817.06,5.039,2819.5795
that makes sense,2820.24,3.599,2822.0395
they're both life or death in this,2822.099,3.72,2823.9590000000003

sure hasn't,3584.22,6.29,3587.365
he wouldn't mind signing this happen,3596.16,5.24,3598.7799999999997
David for Graybar would you Marshall,3597.54,10.079,3602.5795
why don't you wait here,3618.78,4.019,3620.7895000000003
Thompson will show up when he gets tired,3620.7,4.5,3622.95
of waiting for a word of what's happened,3622.799,4.381,3624.9895
uh you don't know Thompson he'll keep,3625.2,4.28,3627.3399999999997
so alive until I find him,3630.0,4.98,3632.49
see if it isn't Ben Thompson if well,3632.339,4.801,3634.7395
there'll always be somebody,3634.98,4.859,3637.4095
maybe maybe what,3637.14,4.56,3639.42
maybe someday you'll run into a faster,3639.839,5.661,3642.6695
Gunner you'll get shot from behind,3641.7,3.8,3643.6
clay why can't the army take care of him,3645.54,4.68,3647.88
if he's mixed up with delgadito it's,3647.76,3.9,3649.71
their job now,3650.22,4.46,3652.45
Abby listen I've got something to finish,3655.079,3.961,3657.0595000000003
and when I do I'm heading back for a,3657.18,3.48,3658.9199999999996
little ranch I've got,3659.04,3.36,3660.72
it's not exactly the kind of life that,3660.66,3.6,3662.46
you'd like,3662.4,5.34,3665.07
not the kind of life I'd like huh,3664.26,4.92,3666.7200000000003
why don't you say what you're really,3667.74,2.879,3669.1794999999997
thinking that I'm not good enough for,3669.18,3.24,3670.7999999999997
you I suppose,3670.619,3.601,3672.4195
wasn't like that this morning was it,3672.42,6.12,3675.48
Abby now listen oh you listen to me,3674.22,6.42,3677.43
maybe I was foolish enough to have some,3678.54,4.44,3680.7599999999998
ideas concerning you maybe I thought I,3680.64,3.959,3682.6195
found a man,3682.98,3.78,3684.87
well all right so I danced in a saloon,3684.599,5.661,3687.4295
and so I put up with all of it,3686.76,3.5,3688.51
well where would you be if someone,3690.359,3.061,3691.8894999999998
hadn't dragged you off the outlaw Trail,3691.68,5.419,3694.3894999999998
and given you a chance to straighten out,3693.42,3.679,3695.2595
rep told me all about it,3698.099,3.5,3699.849
all right Abby once and for all I'm,3702.299,4.02,3704.309
going to tell you something killing,3704.52,3.72,3706.38
Thompson the hard way will serve as an,3706.319,3.54,3708.089
example for every gunman in the,3708.24,3.72,3710.1
territory oh that's your excuse and,3709.859,5.661,3712.6895
there'll always be one won't there,3711.96,3.56,3713.7400000000002
all right go ahead take your shotgun,3724.559,4.56,3726.8390000000004
keep killing only this time you'll be,3726.96,3.599,3728.7595
trying to forget the sight of a man you,3729.119,4.7,3731.469
blistered with buckshot,3730.559,3.26,3732.1890000000003
delgadito greets his friends,3811.64,5.32,3814.2999999999997
friend does not come empty-handed,3814.74,4.74,3817.1099999999997
he went to have brought us guns,3816.96,4.32,3819.12
I couldn't bring the shipment through,3819.48,3.18,3821.07
not with Hardin following me every,3821.28,3.0,3822.78
answer the way,3822.66,3.24,3824.2799999999997
you want those Winchesters maybe you'd,3824.28,3.09,3825.8250000000003
better take care of hard in yourself,3825.9,3.3,3827.55
I have already done much for you,3829.2,4.56,3831.48
you know what happened to Bentley,3831.78,5.16,3834.36
my Apaches have been as your own,3833.76,5.099,3836.3095000000003
you cannot go on this way,3836.94,3.899,3838.8895
it better go on,3838.859,3.181,3840.4494999999997
you and your people want those new,3840.839,3.48,3842.5789999999997
weapons to fight with and perhaps it is,3842.04,4.62,3844.35
wise until at the fighting end,3844.319,3.901,3846.2695
even returning to the white soldiers,3846.66,3.3,3848.31
reservation is better than continuing a,3848.22,4.8,3850.62
fight without hope of winning it,3849.96,4.44,3852.18
that's up to you,3853.02,2.76,3854.4
but you can still have the guns if you,3854.4,3.419,3856.1095
want to string along,3855.78,3.43,3857.4950000000003
better think it over,3857.819,4.82,3860.229
aren't you going to invite me down,3895.2,4.44,3897.4199999999996
why I thought you said everything what,3897.54,3.9,3899.49
are you doing here,3899.64,3.84,3901.56
didn't want to wait around survivalists,3901.44,2.639,3902.7595
Reb said that Rev so that's who brought,3904.079,4.381,3906.2695000000003
you here huh,3906.839,5.101,3909.3894999999998
well where is he back there,3908.46,5.28,3911.1
I thought it'd be best if I came in,3911.94,2.31,3913.0950000000003
suppose you ride back and flag him in,3916.319,4.02,3918.329
don't yell flag him in,3918.42,4.699,3920.7695
how do you take it,3936.42,3.48,3938.16
I'm not sure,3938.22,3.96,3940.2
well I kept my end of the bargain I got,3939.9,4.679,3942.2395
you here see you live up to York,3942.18,4.439,3944.3995
don't worry if I head my way you'd go,3944.579,4.141,3946.6495
after Thompson alone that's the way I,3946.619,3.381,3948.3095000000003
I told you once I didn't want any,3972.96,3.06,3974.4900000000002
buzzards hanging around,3974.579,5.401,3977.2795
quick you stay out of it clay you know I,3976.02,6.299,3979.1695
know I know you're tagging me trying to,3979.98,4.319,3982.1395
get Thompson the safe way more your,3982.319,3.841,3984.2395
blood money using her as an excuse to,3984.299,2.941,3985.7695
maybe you're a necessary breed,3987.24,5.52,3990.0
but not around me,3989.94,5.84,3992.86
you want Thompson,3992.76,3.02,3994.2700000000004
but you got to go through me to get to,3998.819,3.361,4000.4995
what's the matter isn't that gold,4002.18,3.32,4003.8399999999997
shining bright enough rib,4003.44,5.26,4006.07
amateur badge shines even brighter,4005.5,9.46,4010.23
you've been waiting for this a long time,4014.96,5.04,4017.48
haven't you your deal,4017.119,6.18,4020.2090000000003
no no get out of there I told him to,4020.0,4.68,4022.34
bring me out and tell him to take it,4023.299,2.051,4024.3245
good luck clay I guess this is the way,4049.0,5.26,4051.63
it had to be,4052.819,4.141,4054.8894999999998
that's right if you ever make Calexico,4054.26,5.339,4056.9295
ask around,4056.96,4.32,4059.12
yeah yeah I'll do that,4059.599,18.571,4068.8845
may as well start back,4086.839,5.641,4089.6594999999998
let's not make any hasty decision now,4089.539,4.621,4091.8495000000003
before we've had a little coffee and a,4092.48,4.94,4094.95
chance to stretch our legs,4094.16,3.26,4095.79
may have a chance to return me,4099.759,6.1,4102.809
some coffee in my saddlebag puzzling up,4103.1,5.659,4105.9295
while I build a fire,4105.859,2.9,4107.309
it's a little one nobody's gonna see it,4109.16,4.519,4111.4195
rev that's smoke we ought to be getting,4122.839,5.041,4125.3595
out of here don't get touchy nothing's,4125.239,3.901,4127.1894999999995
gonna happen,4127.88,3.0,4129.38
let's get going,4129.14,3.42,4130.85
I'm beginning to get a funny feeling,4130.88,4.439,4133.0995
we're not going back I'm just giving,4132.56,5.219,4135.1695
clay a chance to get a few miles up the,4135.319,5.701,4138.1695
tree we're not going back,4137.779,4.861,4140.209500000001
you know what will happen if you catch,4141.02,4.199,4143.119500000001
up to him I don't aim to I aim to stay,4142.64,4.5,4144.89
just far enough behind to get first,4145.219,5.221,4147.8295
crack if a certain sack of gold shows up,4147.14,6.42,4150.35
then it's Calexico for you and me that's,4150.44,6.08,4153.48
what you want isn't it,4153.56,2.96,4155.04
I suppose so and you better drink up,4157.1,4.8,4159.5
this has got to last distance we got to,4159.799,4.4,4161.999
California,4161.9,2.299,4163.0495
head for the horses,4167.259,12.98,4173.749
Thompson's got some nice Playmates,4243.739,3.601,4245.5395
all right let's get them don't,4247.34,5.899,4250.2895
you know better than that,4250.04,3.199,4251.6395
it'd be slower dying this way but it's,4253.34,4.5,4255.59
less painful,4255.38,3.9,4257.33
grab Carlton pin to a tree,4259.28,6.8,4262.679999999999
oldest Apache trick in the book,4262.159,3.921,4264.1195
it's funny,4266.179,2.48,4267.419
it hadn't been for this I might have,4268.76,3.78,4270.650000000001
gotten it clean,4270.44,4.44,4272.66
Thompson saw this he thought I was a,4272.54,3.24,4274.16
your sidekick,4275.78,4.379,4277.9695
and you're tired,4277.76,4.32,4279.92
you might run into the same luck,4282.08,7.8,4285.98
how about a smoke thanks,4285.86,4.02,4287.87
what do they do with a girl,4290.48,5.34,4293.15
she's with him I got other plans for her,4292.58,6.56,4295.86
she's pretty on me,4295.82,3.32,4297.48
is there anything I can do for it,4300.44,6.0,4303.44
not that it matters I'd like you to know,4303.56,4.2,4305.660000000001
that friend of yours I collected but now,4307.76,4.439,4309.9795
Nelly was giving himself up coming in,4312.199,5.341,4314.8695
without a gun,4315.14,4.38,4317.33
but I guess it wouldn't have made any,4317.54,4.28,4319.68
difference,4319.52,2.3,4320.67
it would pick up the trail about 40,4322.64,4.82,4325.05
yards aren't they,4324.679,2.781,4326.0695000000005
oh leave me again will you patches might,4330.38,6.02,4333.39
won't be long,4342.02,4.289,4344.164500000001
you come a long way for nothing play,4456.92,5.279,4459.5595
I never figured you'd let a gal get you,4460.34,3.3,4461.99
in this kind of a mess,4462.199,4.261,4464.3295
or is it that badge you're wearing I,4463.64,5.64,4466.46
figure I got a pat hand Thompson,4466.46,5.759,4469.3395
against 50-1,4469.28,4.68,4471.62
my back's all right so long as I'm,4472.219,2.531,4473.4845000000005
facing you,4473.96,4.98,4476.45
go ahead why don't you try,4478.94,4.44,4481.16
delgadito I come as a friend,4483.38,5.58,4486.17
I want no fight with you or with your,4486.98,3.42,4488.69
I want the white girl in this man the,4490.4,5.339,4493.0695
Apaches are a brave Nation they respect,4493.28,4.8,4495.679999999999
bravery in all men,4495.739,5.881,4498.679499999999
he wants girl too he brings us guns he,4498.08,4.68,4500.42
is our friend,4501.62,4.2,4503.72
your friend since when did Delgado a,4502.76,6.3,4505.91
great Chief call a coward a friend,4505.82,5.58,4508.61
Howard I'll fight him anytime with any,4509.06,5.06,4511.59
kind of weapons,4511.4,2.72,4512.759999999999
it's a duel with these,4520.96,4.44,4523.18
still heading for Calexico,4767.06,4.86,4769.490000000001
not unless you are,4769.64,5.039,4772.159500000001
I was thinking of a ranch,4771.92,4.91,4774.375
might be the kind of Life you'd like,4774.679,40.85,4795.104

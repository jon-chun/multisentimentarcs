Custer can't have over 300 men they'll,975.66,4.38,977.85

I'm giving you back the only part of,2054.94,4.34,2057.11
Celia I ever had,2056.379,2.901,2057.8295

she doesn't even know I have it,2069.52,3.379,2071.2095
seems sending for you is the only way I,2087.54,4.0,2089.54
can see you,2089.919,4.081,2091.9595
nearly three weeks you haven't even,2091.54,5.44,2094.2599999999998
looked at me let alone spoken to me,2094.0,7.859,2097.9295
we have to get this settled before Phil,2101.859,4.521,2104.1195

at least this time we're alone,2108.78,4.079,2110.8195
didn't you want to see me,2113.02,3.2,2114.62
I'd rather spend one minute with you I'm,2116.8,3.84,2118.7200000000003
leaving when you leave,2119.2,3.18,2120.79

aren't you yes I have,2123.64,4.68,2125.98
that's why I haven't seen you for nearly,2126.579,3.0,2128.079
three weeks,2128.32,2.88,2129.76
why we've both been making up our minds,2131.2,3.3,2132.85
you've come to one conclusion,2134.5,5.04,2137.02
but I've come to another,2137.2,4.8,2139.6
what other is there,2139.54,4.02,2141.55
I know you're well enough to know them,2142.0,3.06,2143.53
that before everything else you're,2143.56,5.64,2146.38
honest with yourself with me,2145.06,6.779,2148.4495
no you'll give me an honest answer,2149.2,5.7,2152.0499999999997
if your husband was leaving the Army and,2154.9,5.12,2157.46
going back east as I am,2156.76,3.26,2158.3900000000003
you'll be willing to leave,2160.119,5.37,2162.804
that's what I thought,2178.0,2.9,2179.45
that's why I put in my application for,2182.32,3.6,2184.1200000000003
transfer instead of,2184.0,4.94,2186.47
instead of resignation,2185.92,3.02,2187.4300000000003
wait for him Celie,2190.42,4.5,2192.67

ahead make a good place to stop a while,2219.88,3.9,2221.83
except the Sioux would expect in a,2221.98,3.5,2223.73
Detachment in this area to stop there,2223.78,3.9,2225.73
the only other waters over behind that,2225.48,5.379,2228.1695

I figure what's the most writing Point,3223.319,4.381,3225.5095
could cost me my life,3224.819,4.74,3227.189
mine's another life a man wants to hang,3227.7,3.48,3229.4399999999996

with the others,3241.5,2.66,3242.83
break out your neck DeWalt we're cutting,3248.28,4.079,3250.3195
High guard to see who rides out in front,3250.559,5.161,3253.1395
cut cards if the Walsh deck one thing's,3252.359,4.401,3254.5595
himself the job,3256.76,3.48,3258.5
that eliminates cutting you know the,3264.96,3.72,3266.82
backs of those cards as well as the,3267.24,4.02,3269.25
front easy,3268.68,4.919,3271.1394999999998

common horse senses to draw by rank,3273.599,5.96,3276.579
lead out person,3276.66,2.899,3278.1095
remember a high man goes,3280.14,3.56,3281.92

why does anybody got a right point when,3295.52,4.599,3297.8195
it's safer to ride in a bunch The Army,3298.02,3.539,3299.7895
Goes On the theory that the loss of a,3300.119,2.821,3301.5295
few to save money brings the best,3301.559,3.621,3303.3695000000002

Deuce of space like I thought,3356.94,6.06,3359.9700000000003
the lowest in the deck,3359.88,4.739,3362.2495
that's the way it goes,3363.0,3.54,3364.77
you don't have to draw a second,3364.619,5.121,3367.1795
I want to build a tent,3366.54,3.2,3368.14
hold on a minute I got more time in than,3372.18,4.82,3374.5899999999997

it's very easy to come in on a tough job,3460.5,3.359,3462.1795
and fight against a man who has to get,3462.18,3.48,3463.9199999999996
a whole regiment is marching into a trap,3465.66,4.62,3467.97
and you're mothering a 15-man patrol,3467.88,3.959,3469.8595

it's like a vet Moylan give me a hand,3669.9,3.419,3671.6095
with dewald,3672.18,3.24,3673.7999999999997
shovels spread your blanket out onto,3673.319,4.401,3675.5195
well that's how it is,3686.22,3.599,3688.0195
you gotta go on,3688.38,3.239,3689.9995
who will you leave with him,3689.819,4.461,3692.0495
that's what has to be done,3694.619,6.74,3697.989
sacrifice a few to save many,3697.38,3.979,3699.3695000000002
be careful with them,3706.859,3.72,3708.719
haven't been for this canteens let's be,3708.599,3.181,3710.1895
real careful,3710.579,4.701,3712.9295
so he can die comfortably,3711.78,3.5,3713.53
Heather minful this can't team with,3715.5,2.579,3716.7895
theirs and see that he has plenty of,3716.94,3.44,3718.66
leave your canteen and your spare,3722.099,3.48,3723.839
rations with him,3723.839,3.301,3725.4895
that sounds like we're going to lead him,3725.579,2.461,3726.8095000000003
here alone,3727.14,3.179,3728.7295
that's right,3728.04,4.68,3730.38
you'll leave his horse there a horse,3730.319,4.201,3732.4195
could be spotted,3732.72,4.5,3734.97
I won't need a horse,3734.52,5.52,3737.28
I could use a carving though I lost my,3737.22,6.02,3740.23
I'll bring a cop in,3740.04,3.2,3741.64
this was Tim Harvey's,3746.28,3.44,3748.0
I'll be all right,3752.339,4.641,3754.6594999999998
have him out up sergeant,3753.9,3.08,3755.44
good luck to walk,3759.24,2.839,3760.6594999999998
why that dirty cold libert,3762.78,4.98,3765.27
I'm not gonna ride off and leave Al you,3765.48,3.54,3767.25
heard the word,3767.76,5.839,3770.6795
clam aboard but those saddles,3769.02,4.579,3771.3095
I said climb aboard,3774.42,3.199,3776.0195
the way it goes,3779.16,2.959,3780.6394999999998
you wondering what design on the mind of,3795.059,4.8,3797.4590000000003
a man that's been left behind to die,3796.68,6.0,3799.68
I'm wondering which one to send ahead,3799.859,4.44,3802.0789999999997
every man you've sent out to ride Point,3802.68,3.48,3804.4199999999996
has been killed or injured,3804.299,3.54,3806.069
you think knowing that makes it easy to,3806.16,3.86,3808.0899999999997
who would you send,3810.599,5.24,3813.219
that's easy,3813.119,2.72,3814.4790000000003
he sent Mr a with the right Point what's,3827.64,4.32,3829.7999999999997
he trying to do more to the lieutenant,3830.28,3.36,3831.96
you think he wouldn't,3831.96,4.379,3834.1495
look what he's doing to DeWalt,3833.64,6.419,3836.8495
all right yo,3836.339,3.72,3838.199
the command is forward route order,3926.76,4.579,3929.0495
Miss Letty coming all the way down from,3957.18,7.58,3960.97
Canada just purely to be Mrs James,3959.7,5.06,3962.23
say maybe she's already at the fort,3966.299,8.06,3970.329
just waiting for me Mason,3969.78,4.579,3972.0695
I told you we're not putting up our,3978.2,4.599,3980.4995
shelters I'm following Captain darling's,3980.4,4.02,3982.4100000000003
orders and so should you be you never,3982.799,3.78,3984.689
soldiered without the wall did you and,3984.42,4.199,3986.5195
now Mr Haywood ain't come back,3986.579,3.421,3988.2895000000003
so you're going to put up your shell to,3988.619,3.901,3990.5695
turn in and sleep in peace huh,3990.0,3.839,3991.9195
don't have any of you want to get up,3992.52,3.66,3994.35
there to reach the seventh we all do son,3993.839,4.321,3995.9995
but we figure this is the only way we,3996.18,4.46,3998.41
got a chance,3998.16,2.48,3999.3999999999996
is that the way you figure Mr vet,4000.92,6.3,4004.07
yes I do Davey got kind of fun of the,4004.099,4.321,4006.2595
lieutenant,4007.22,2.7,4008.5699999999997
we don't need the kid come on let's get,4008.42,3.919,4010.3795
the horses,4009.92,2.419,4011.1295
play Sergeant Grayson in a second on,4014.599,4.821,4017.0095
pickettson,4016.76,2.66,4018.09
skateboarders to get your shelters up,4019.94,3.44,4021.66
we're going ahead captain,4024.079,5.0,4026.579
to find Mr Hayward,4026.059,3.02,4027.5690000000004
I could have each one of your shot for,4031.4,2.459,4032.6295
like you did DeWalt captain,4033.859,3.44,4035.5789999999997
I wish every man whose written Point had,4039.859,4.321,4042.0195
come back they haven't but we're blind,4041.9,4.62,4044.21
without a point,4044.18,3.48,4045.9199999999996
all right get your shelters up and turn,4046.52,3.0,4048.02
in those are orders,4047.66,3.659,4049.4894999999997
we're not going to disobey those orders,4049.52,2.88,4050.96
it's just that we're not going to obey,4052.4,4.1,4054.4500000000003
can I tell you something sir,4058.099,3.141,4059.6695
speak out sergeant,4062.359,2.96,4063.839
a man looks at it like this,4065.42,3.619,4067.2295
sacrificing a few to save money is all,4069.319,6.48,4072.5589999999997
right as long as he's not one of the few,4071.9,7.32,4075.56
it's hard to be one of the few captains,4075.799,5.161,4078.3795
we figure Lieutenant Hayward thinks like,4079.22,5.339,4081.8894999999998
us which makes him our only chance,4080.96,6.78,4084.35
maybe he's just heard out there,4084.559,6.141,4087.6295
waiting for us,4087.74,2.96,4089.22
we're going up ahead to see,4090.74,4.26,4092.87
and if they bunched up they jump you,4093.559,2.881,4094.9995000000004
like they jumped hey when nobody gets,4095.0,3.56,4096.78
all of you heard my orders,4100.04,6.299,4103.1895
or get your shelters up and turn in,4103.04,6.06,4106.07
what happened Captain Dallas it's Mr,4106.339,3.991,4108.3345
Mr Hayward is coming here,4116.779,3.201,4118.3795
I'm like bunched up but they're not,4126.679,3.421,4128.3895
waiting for us looks like they found,4128.239,3.901,4130.1894999999995
something more important up ahead,4130.1,4.259,4132.2295
I don't know what,4132.14,4.94,4134.610000000001
well I mean,4134.359,2.721,4135.7195
this isn't going to settle anything and,4144.98,3.54,4146.75
it violates every regulation I know of,4146.42,3.66,4148.25
maybe the only satisfaction I'll ever,4148.52,4.199,4150.619500000001
get no rank,4150.08,3.84,4152.0
that's right,4152.719,4.46,4154.949
just you just me,4153.92,3.259,4155.5495
because I'm believing in what I stand,4157.219,3.661,4159.0495
for is wrong,4158.66,4.199,4160.7595
prettier you might be,4160.88,4.26,4163.01
you've seen this Patrol lose men but,4162.859,3.36,4164.539000000001
they're only a fraction of what will be,4165.14,2.52,4166.400000000001
lost if we don't make it the only way we,4166.219,3.841,4168.1395
can make it is my way you ready,4167.66,5.3,4170.3099999999995
I've been ready along,4170.06,2.9,4171.51
as long as nobody wants to waste time,4224.0,2.52,4225.26
I'm sorry with me,4226.52,3.02,4228.030000000001
Sergeant McLeod,4229.82,2.96,4231.299999999999
send in Sergeant Grayson,4234.56,6.8,4237.96
and have the patrols Saddle Up,4237.92,3.44,4239.64
I want to tune in the right point,4242.96,4.5,4245.21
you know the risk you'll be running me,4245.179,3.961,4247.1595
me too sir all right,4249.14,6.3,4252.29
these last 50 miles are going to be,4252.14,4.98,4254.63
pretty rough,4255.44,4.02,4257.45
let's get going,4257.12,5.42,4259.83
you all right sir,4259.46,3.08,4261.0
I guess this is what the Sioux thought,4399.199,4.701,4401.549499999999
was more important,4400.94,2.96,4402.419999999999
operation and vet,4404.54,3.56,4406.32
been dead a couple of hours,4448.64,3.5,4450.39
maybe you'd better not see it,4455.239,3.381,4456.929499999999
coming down to America,4459.02,2.96,4460.5
we can't wait to bury it,4464.78,3.2,4466.38
sorry Carla can I have a minute,4468.08,6.079,4471.1195
make it fast,4471.38,2.779,4472.7695
why you're even prettier than your,4483.62,3.9,4485.57
I've been purely proud,4487.52,3.86,4489.450000000001
this is James cordless,4501.58,5.63,4504.3949999999995
this man fight on foot,4532.94,6.02,4535.95
TV dismount,4538.96,3.54,4540.7300000000005
spread out,4542.719,11.371,4548.4045
pick up those horses,4605.78,2.959,4607.2595
that's all,4648.32,2.78,4649.71
there's your Little Bighorn River,4671.719,4.681,4674.0595
look what's waiting for custard to come,4674.78,2.34,4675.95
now to sign a Custer yet,4677.12,4.02,4679.13
we made it in time,4679.219,3.301,4680.8695
until we get through those still we,4681.14,2.7,4682.490000000001
haven't made it,4682.52,2.9,4683.97
let's get back,4683.84,12.149,4689.9145
pretty bad sir,4704.0,5.1,4706.55
what's the report we're only a mile from,4706.28,5.64,4709.099999999999
the Little Bighorn River so my,4709.1,4.619,4711.409500000001
the seventh haven't shown on the other,4711.92,4.279,4714.0595
there's only one way in or out on the,4717.98,3.719,4719.839499999999
other side of the Riverside the seal got,4719.719,3.661,4721.5495
a block solid,4721.699,3.661,4723.5295
which means if we're going to cross the,4723.38,4.88,4725.82
little big aren't we,4725.36,2.9,4726.8099999999995
they can't go around them we've got to,4731.719,3.841,4733.6395
go through them they'll be waiting for,4733.699,4.321,4735.8595
us they spotted me and Mason we saw,4735.56,3.84,4737.4800000000005
their signal,4738.02,4.04,4740.040000000001
that's all,4739.4,2.66,4740.73
right it'll take too long to go around,4752.84,5.58,4755.63
but it's up to you,4755.48,4.86,4757.91
I could order men to risk their lives as,4758.42,3.6,4760.22
long as I could risk mine with them but,4760.34,3.6,4762.14
now that there's no more risk for me I,4762.02,4.38,4764.21
can't give that kind of an order,4763.94,5.16,4766.5199999999995
this is the reason I brought you along,4766.4,4.62,4768.71
you're in command now you've got to make,4769.1,3.139,4770.6695
the decision,4771.02,5.179,4773.6095000000005
make it the best you know how,4772.239,3.96,4774.218999999999
we made it in time after all,4819.26,4.56,4821.54
I think the man Left Behind would have,4822.14,2.8,4823.54
thought it was worth it,4823.82,4.29,4825.965
your way got us this far and there's a,4839.5,5.56,4842.28
chance it'll get us across the river,4841.82,4.68,4844.16
some of the men will come with me I,4845.06,2.58,4846.35
think they should be given that choice,4846.5,2.46,4847.73
that's up to you,4848.96,3.02,4850.47
any longer lieutenant,4875.26,5.82,4878.17
it's up to you,4878.3,2.78,4879.6900000000005
take your place sergeant,4885.14,3.2,4886.740000000001
all right sir,4893.48,2.96,4894.959999999999
comedy front,4901.46,2.9,4902.91
time to go around we're going straight,4911.179,3.06,4912.709
we go in strong with plenty of fanfare,4914.239,3.181,4915.8295
there's a chance they'll think we're in,4916.219,2.821,4917.6295
front of a regiment,4917.42,4.86,4919.85
that's our only chance,4919.04,5.1,4921.59
some of you may feel it's wrong to,4922.28,5.3,4924.929999999999
sacrifice a few to save many,4924.14,3.44,4925.860000000001
those who feel that way I give,4928.159,5.301,4930.809499999999
permission to turn back,4930.5,2.96,4931.98
somebody has to sound the charge soon,4966.199,3.561,4967.9794999999995
make it loud Stevie for the ones we left,5038.1,4.68,5040.4400000000005

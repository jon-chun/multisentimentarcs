still stands,103.7,6.64,107.02
the Comanches called it squash head Rock,106.02,7.02,109.53
time cannot change its impassive face,110.34,5.819,113.2495
nor dim the legend of the wild young,113.04,6.24,116.16000000000001
lovers who found heaven and hell,116.159,5.82,119.069
in the shadows of The Rock,119.28,5.1,121.83
for when the sun is low and the cold,121.979,4.801,124.3795
wind blows across the desert,124.38,4.5,126.63
there are those of Indian blood who,126.78,4.56,129.06
still speak of pearl Chavez the,128.88,4.2,130.98
half-breed girl from down along the,131.34,4.2,133.44
border and of the Laughing Outlaw with,133.08,5.82,135.99
whom she here kept a final Rondon,135.54,6.36,138.72
never to be seen again,138.9,5.699,141.7495
and this is what the legend says,141.9,6.419,145.1095
a flower no nowhere else grows from out,144.599,5.581,147.3895
of the desperate Crags where Pearl,148.319,6.121,151.37949999999998
vanished Pearl was herself a wildflower,150.18,6.779,153.5695
sprung from the hard clay,154.44,4.98,156.93
quick to Blossom,156.959,5.601,159.7595
and early to die,159.42,3.14,160.98999999999998
where's you more,190.44,4.86,192.87
she's in there dance like mother like,192.3,5.159,194.8795

daughter better let go,199.26,5.839,202.1795
you go away from here I'll call my paw,202.56,6.3,205.71
that Renegade Creole score man that's a,205.099,5.441,207.81949999999998
broke again yes gentlemen,362.759,4.921,365.21950000000004
but there are greater Treasures but I'm,365.88,2.94,367.35
sure you wouldn't understand,367.68,20.489,377.9245
oh you take me in the Presidio I ain't,413.88,4.62,416.19
never been in there and you never should,416.94,2.819,418.3495
what are you doing out here this hour,419.759,4.141,421.8295
anywhere I was just dancing I've told,421.08,4.08,423.12
your mother repeated that this street is,423.9,3.239,425.5195
no place for a girl your age,425.16,5.72,428.02000000000004
I didn't mean no harmful,427.139,3.741,429.0095
it's my fortune I'm not yours,433.919,6.861,437.3495
the sins of the fathers,437.039,3.741,438.9095
I'll be back in a little while,444.539,9.121,449.0995
I feel no mitigating circumstances they,487.139,5.161,489.7195
deserve to die as I deserve to die,489.18,4.98,491.67
for a long since killed a person much,492.3,3.78,494.19
Superior to either of them,494.16,3.78,496.05
I killed that person the day I gave my,497.94,3.9,499.89
family's name to the woman who became my,499.979,3.66,501.80899999999997
and since I believe the punishment,503.639,3.24,505.259
should fit the crime,505.319,3.361,506.9995
I suggested you hang me by the neck,506.879,3.371,508.5645
until I'm dead,508.68,5.7,511.53000000000003

different world,536.04,4.38,538.23

you have to do is behave like a lady oh,1243.14,4.44,1245.3600000000001
not that Scotch ave's daughter could,1246.02,3.96,1248.0

you'll be the only young girl that,1256.46,3.48,1258.2
Spanish bit,1258.32,3.54,1260.09

would turned a little no you take Luton,1261.86,6.42,1265.07
for instance he's such an attractive boy,1264.2,6.599,1267.4995000000001
I think Jess is much nicer but you,1268.28,4.8,1270.68
scarcely know Luton of course he's a bit,1270.799,3.721,1272.6595
undisciplined but,1273.08,3.3,1274.73
perhaps that's what gives westerners,1274.52,5.88,1277.46
their charm the senator was like that,1276.38,7.34,1280.0500000000002
that's why when your father,1280.4,3.32,1282.0600000000002
Jesse always chides me for talking about,1284.48,5.88,1287.42
the past I hope Jesse likes me we're,1286.64,6.06,1289.67
going to lose him someday I've known,1290.36,3.84,1292.28
that ever since he came back from Law,1292.7,2.76,1294.0800000000002
oh I've been so selfish why he'd have,1295.46,5.339,1298.1295

small ranches from the new railroad are,2070.3,6.859,2073.7295000000004
too numerous to need recounting here,2074.02,6.839,2077.4395
small wrenches ignorant nesters fall in,2077.159,6.101,2080.2095
the open range with their measly fences,2080.859,5.28,2083.499
and say Jesse I should have told you,2083.26,5.94,2086.23

to do it you're gone plum crazy I don't,2108.52,4.86,2110.95
think so I thought it might be a good,2111.52,3.66,2113.35
idea to cooperate and have the tracks,2113.38,4.86,2115.81

Paradise Flats will become a real town,2125.079,5.881,2128.0195000000003
and that same Railway will ship a lot of,2127.3,6.6,2130.6000000000004
immigrants from up North down here and,2130.96,6.24,2134.08

there be a spirit track right on Spanish,5254.139,3.6,5255.939
bit then they could just ship the cattle,5255.699,3.181,5257.2895

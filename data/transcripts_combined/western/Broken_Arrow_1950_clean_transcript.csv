this is the story of a land,92.34,4.44,94.56
of the people who lived on it in the,94.92,5.22,97.53
year 1870 and of a man whose name was,96.78,6.54,100.05
Cochise he was an Indian leader of the,100.14,5.58,102.93
chirokawa Apache tribe,103.32,5.58,106.11
I was involved in the story and what I,105.72,4.92,108.17999999999999
have to tell happened exactly as you'll,108.9,4.679,111.2395
see it the only change will be that when,110.64,5.64,113.46
the Apaches speak they will speak in our,113.579,3.781,115.4695
what took place is part of the history,117.36,3.24,118.98
of Arizona,119.159,3.721,121.01950000000001
and it began for me here where you see,120.6,3.479,122.3395
since getting out of the Union Army I'd,124.079,4.02,126.089
been prospecting for gold off and on and,126.0,4.02,128.01
one day I got a message that a new,128.099,3.901,130.0495
Colonel had come to Tucson wanted to see,130.02,4.32,132.18
me the story started when I saw some,132.0,5.06,134.53
buzzards circling in the sky,134.34,5.58,137.13
buzzer to Smart bird,137.06,5.92,140.02
something or somebody was getting ready,139.92,4.26,142.04999999999998
I figured was a hurt deer or rabbit or,144.18,5.059,146.70950000000002
not a rabbit not a dare,152.239,8.08,156.279
His Kind was more dangerous than a snake,156.02,6.7,159.37
he was an Apache,160.319,5.101,162.8695
for 10 years we'd been on a Savage war,162.72,5.519,165.4795
with his people a bloody no give no take,165.42,3.3,167.07
I knew it was dangerous to keep a fire,245.78,4.959,248.2595
going in Apache country but the boy's,248.28,4.379,250.4695
wounds were badly infected and he was,250.739,3.78,252.629
running a high fever,252.659,4.14,254.72899999999998
he had eight pieces of Buckshot in his,254.519,4.201,256.6195
back and I had to dig every one of them,256.799,3.84,258.719
out with my knife,258.72,3.6,260.52000000000004
I could hear him grinding his teeth,260.639,4.5,262.889
together but he never let out a sound,262.32,4.68,264.65999999999997
for the next few days I panned the,265.139,4.62,267.449
stream for gold kept an eye on the boy I,267.0,4.44,269.22
wanted to be on the move and I was glad,269.759,3.661,271.5895
he was getting his strength back quickly,271.44,7.489,275.1845
now you've still got a lamp,287.3,6.94,290.77000000000004
today I must leave now I must go too,290.759,6.66,294.089
soon for you for my legs yes but for my,294.24,6.42,297.45
family no this is my novice time I am 14,297.419,6.181,300.5095
so I learned to be a man I go on trips,300.66,4.08,302.70000000000005
but I have been away too long,304.74,5.459,307.4695
and I wake you up my mother is crying my,307.32,5.04,309.84
father looks for me I think,310.199,4.681,312.53950000000003
I am their only one now,312.36,4.44,314.58000000000004
my brother and my sister were killed at,314.88,3.45,316.605
my mother is crying he said,328.62,6.0,331.62
honey it never struck me that an Apache,332.28,4.08,334.32
woman would cry over her son like any,334.62,3.06,336.15
other woman,336.36,4.27,338.495
Apaches are wild animals we all said,337.68,5.519,340.4395
do you pray to killer of enemies,343.199,6.601,346.4995
not even to life Giver,347.16,4.379,349.34950000000003
the ones up there,349.8,3.06,351.33
we have another name Apaches pray for,352.86,4.679,355.1995
all white men to die,355.5,5.1,358.05
but now I pray to keep you safe,357.539,5.88,360.479
at Sunset last night I threw pollen to,360.6,4.64,362.92
the Four Winds for you,363.419,3.72,365.279

I know my people they have been watching,387.36,5.72,390.22
us they say I am not harmed,389.34,3.74,391.21
this is Clear Talk it says they can,398.759,4.581,401.0495
still kill,400.86,2.48,402.1
this white man is my friend,414.18,6.98,417.67
this white man is my friend,417.24,3.92,419.2
he must not be heard when did my son,447.78,6.0,450.78
become a tame Apache father look he gave,450.3,5.459,453.0295
me life again when the soldiers wounded,453.78,4.38,455.96999999999997
me where did you meet soldiers,455.759,4.921,458.21950000000004
it will shame us to say when a party,458.16,4.02,460.17
should not do what others cannot know,460.68,4.799,463.0795
this one he was with them no he found me,462.18,6.419,465.3895
later he healed me it will be wrong to,465.479,6.66,468.80899999999997
harm him you do not give orders,468.599,6.241,471.7195

wait 90 many dollars for the scalp of an,474.84,5.04,477.35999999999996
Apache you know that I know then why did,477.24,4.38,479.43
you not take his skill,479.88,4.08,481.92
if I kill an Apache it will not be for,481.62,5.16,484.2
scalp or money why not my people in your,483.96,4.92,486.41999999999996
people are at War it is not my way to,486.78,3.72,488.64
fight there's a way of all white eyes,488.88,6.08,491.92
it's not my way you are a woman Maybe,490.5,4.46,492.73
it is well known that Apaches do not,495.78,3.479,497.5195
take scallops either and they are not,497.819,2.401,499.0195
he hides something why are you here in,500.22,4.14,502.29
our mountains,502.919,5.101,505.4695
I look for gold and silver for what,504.36,6.619,507.6695

we will not kill this time,514.38,4.56,516.66
but not again,516.839,3.47,518.5740000000001
give him his gun,518.94,10.369,524.1245
they wanted to kill me all right but,530.94,3.42,532.6500000000001
they let me go,532.56,3.839,534.4794999999999
I learned things that day,534.36,5.039,536.8795
Apache mothers cried about their sons,536.399,7.341,540.0695
actually man had a sense of fair play,539.399,4.341,541.5695
how do you say,549.12,7.189,552.7145
two men were killed and for three others,654.44,4.42,656.6500000000001
it was much worse because they were only,657.24,3.18,658.83
but this was war and it was terrible,660.42,5.599,663.2194999999999
cruelty from both sides,662.7,3.319,664.3595
pouching one of the Wounded men and in,667.5,3.72,669.36
the pouch there were three Apache,669.54,3.0,671.04
so they dug a pit on the ground and they,672.54,4.02,674.55
rubbed his face with the juice of a,674.82,4.519,677.0795
Mezcal plant,676.56,2.779,677.9495
learn it learn it well this is Apache,685.5,5.1,688.05

Juan will you teach me I want to speak,1098.539,3.961,1100.5194999999999

yes I will teach you and for this I will,1104.78,4.92,1107.24
not take any dollars but I think it will,1107.6,6.56,1110.8799999999999
end bad I think Cochise would kill you,1109.7,4.46,1111.93
well Mel can we use the office,1115.34,5.42,1118.05

says you come in peace they will not,1134.419,3.481,1136.1595000000002
believe it but perhaps it'll make them,1136.46,3.18,1138.05
want to find out,1137.9,3.3,1139.5500000000002
you've learned to speak our language,1139.64,4.32,1141.8000000000002
well you do not yet think like an Apache,1141.2,5.219,1143.8095
but you are not distant from it Juan,1143.96,4.38,1146.15
you've been a good guide,1146.419,4.861,1148.8495
if I see Cochise what grows from our,1148.34,5.52,1151.1
talks will be from you too last night I,1151.28,5.279,1153.9195
heard an owl the worst of all signs it,1153.86,4.679,1156.1995
is not yet too late come back with me,1156.559,4.201,1158.6595
they will kill you,1158.539,4.681,1160.8795
I didn't hear they all won but thank you,1160.76,3.79,1162.655
if you see him do not lie to him not in,1172.76,5.82,1175.67
the smallest thing his eyes will see,1176.12,4.919,1178.5794999999998
into your heart he is greater than other,1178.58,3.2,1180.1799999999998
I never felt so lonely and so dog scared,1218.96,4.38,1221.15
for three days I climbed higher into the,1223.34,4.14,1225.4099999999999
mountains in which the Apache stronghold,1225.679,2.751,1227.0545000000002
was hidden,1227.48,11.84,1233.4
of the third day I was nearing the,1303.1,4.36,1305.28
entrance to the stronghold,1305.299,5.281,1307.9395
one had told me what to look for,1307.46,5.04,1309.98
I knew then that Cochise had given me,1310.58,4.14,1312.6499999999999
permission to enter her,1312.5,4.32,1314.66
I kept my hands visible,1314.72,5.24,1317.34
away from my weapons,1316.82,3.14,1318.3899999999999
look at ease,1320.36,18.679,1329.6995
patches is the greatest Indian leader,1436.6,5.5,1439.35
I've come to speak to him about the,1440.0,4.08,1442.04
welfare of his people,1442.1,4.38,1444.29
it is known that he respects truth as he,1444.08,5.479,1446.8194999999998
respects bravery,1446.48,3.079,1448.0195
you hold these for me,1461.6,3.38,1463.29
I'll want them when I leave,1465.559,3.321,1467.2195
how do you know you will leave here,1471.62,3.62,1473.4299999999998
I am coaches,1480.26,5.0,1482.76
when the Indian wishes to Signal his,1487.34,6.199,1490.4395
brother he does so by smoke signs,1489.5,4.039,1491.5195
this is The White Man's signal,1493.94,5.04,1496.46
my brother's far away can look at this,1496.52,4.38,1498.71
and understand my meaning,1498.98,4.559,1501.2595000000001
we call this mail,1500.9,4.62,1503.21
and the men who carry the male are like,1503.539,4.14,1505.609
the air that carries the Apache smoke,1505.52,3.72,1507.3799999999999
now they seek no trouble,1509.24,4.679,1511.5795
yet your warriors kill them,1511.52,4.44,1513.74
I have come here to ask you that you let,1513.919,5.481,1516.6595000000002
these men travel in safety,1515.96,3.44,1517.68
this male carries War signals against us,1519.559,5.041,1522.0795
oh no this is this is used for other,1522.559,4.561,1524.8395

military by special ways,1527.12,4.08,1529.1599999999999
sometimes they use a thing we call the,1531.2,3.66,1533.03
other times by men like me,1534.86,5.4,1537.56
you have carried messages against us,1538.159,6.421,1541.3695
when I was a scout for the military yes,1540.26,8.419,1544.4695
you have fought us yes,1544.58,4.099,1546.6295
and the Battle of Apache Pass,1552.74,3.679,1554.5795

I am the leader of my people,1603.919,4.561,1606.1995000000002
they do not betray me and I do not,1606.32,3.9,1608.27
betray them,1608.48,4.26,1610.6100000000001
we fight for our land against Americans,1610.22,5.54,1612.99
who try to take it,1612.74,3.02,1614.25
you give me no reason why I should not,1615.919,4.86,1618.3490000000002
kill American male writers,1617.9,5.279,1620.5395
and kill you too,1620.779,5.88,1623.719
you were not asked to come here,1623.179,6.061,1626.2095000000002
now writers do you no harm there were,1626.659,5.101,1629.2095000000002
Apaches who did your people no harm they,1629.24,4.679,1631.5795
were hanged one was my brother my people,1631.76,4.2,1633.86
have done yours great wrong I say this,1633.919,3.841,1635.8395
to you as I've said it to them,1635.96,4.14,1638.03
do you think because I'm an Indian I'm a,1637.76,4.56,1640.04
fool you can trick me I would not have,1640.1,4.86,1642.53
come here if I thought that a fool sees,1642.32,4.56,1644.6
only today it is because I respect you,1644.96,3.54,1646.73
as a leader of your people that I think,1646.88,3.659,1648.7095000000002
of tomorrow,1648.5,3.9,1650.45
what is it about tomorrow,1650.539,5.161,1653.1195
the Apaches are warriors without equal,1652.4,5.1,1654.95
but compared to the whites they're small,1655.7,3.3,1657.3500000000001
in number and tomorrow they will be,1657.5,3.96,1659.48
I will not talk of that with you,1661.46,4.98,1663.95
is it not possible that your people and,1663.919,4.681,1666.2595000000001
mind can someday live together like,1666.44,4.32,1668.6000000000001
it is Strange Talk from a white man,1670.76,6.72,1674.12
your people do not want peace they've,1675.26,4.62,1677.57
taught me that this male can be the,1677.48,5.34,1680.15
first step I asked you to think on it,1679.88,4.799,1682.2795
why should that the white man ACT first,1682.82,3.839,1684.7395
do you want me to be better than the,1684.679,4.801,1687.0795
white man a white man has come here,1686.659,6.12,1689.719
now I ask you to think of your people,1689.48,6.059,1692.5095000000001
and look at tomorrow,1692.779,6.441,1695.9995
my mind must work on it,1695.539,3.681,1697.3795
you will rest here tonight it is my,1706.22,3.78,1708.1100000000001
strong wish,1708.44,3.599,1710.2395000000001
walk with me so my people will see us,1710.0,3.539,1711.7695
so you will be safe here,1713.539,3.5,1715.289
what is the meaning of the dance,1768.679,4.561,1770.9595000000002
spirits of Good and Evil are dancing not,1770.539,4.38,1772.729
everyone can do it if it's done wrong,1773.24,4.2,1775.34
they will be angry over there I think,1774.919,4.441,1777.1395
this must be the dance that comes before,1777.44,5.16,1780.02
the sunrise ceremony for a young girl,1779.36,6.12,1782.4199999999998
you know that a little bit,1782.6,5.959,1785.5794999999998
without words it tells anything,1785.48,5.64,1788.3
yes you are very different from other,1788.559,6.161,1791.6395
white stuff and then you speak our,1791.12,5.76,1794.0
try to understand our ways,1796.88,5.399,1799.5795
well it is good to understand the ways,1800.24,4.52,1802.5
I respect your people Cochise,1805.58,5.339,1808.2495
you know what I am thinking,1808.399,4.741,1810.7694999999999
maybe someday you won't kill me or I,1810.919,3.721,1812.7795
will kill you,1813.14,5.18,1815.73
we will not spit on each other,1814.64,3.68,1816.48
that is how I feel,1818.36,3.199,1819.9595
the girl inside the wiki up is in the,1822.74,3.84,1824.66
holiest time of her life,1824.96,3.42,1826.67
for these four days she becomes white,1826.58,4.56,1828.86
Painted Lady mother of life,1828.38,4.98,1830.8700000000001
it's good luck to visit her now,1831.14,4.44,1833.3600000000001
would you like to visit her yes,1833.36,3.84,1835.28
were you ever wounded,1835.58,3.18,1837.1699999999998
we will tell her,1838.76,3.539,1840.5295
but this night only this girl is even,1840.44,4.02,1842.45
more holy than most maybe because she,1842.299,4.681,1844.6395
has been away from us for a long time,1844.46,5.04,1846.98
she's very old for this ceremony,1846.98,5.36,1849.66
it's very special,1849.5,2.84,1850.92
white painted lady,1860.779,5.521,1863.5395
I have old walls,1863.84,6.83,1867.2549999999999
but each scar is a mark of love for your,1871.7,4.14,1873.77
path of your people is stretched long,1875.84,3.66,1877.6699999999998
behind you,1877.76,3.419,1879.4695
you are the head,1879.5,3.72,1881.36
and you are the heart,1881.179,4.441,1883.3995
and you are the blood,1883.22,4.92,1885.68
killer of enemies is your father and you,1885.62,5.179,1888.2095
are his son,1888.14,2.659,1889.4695000000002
I have brought someone with me,1896.539,5.461,1899.2694999999999
then he is welcome,1899.659,5.721,1902.5195

give me your arm,1920.96,3.079,1922.4995000000001
does it hurt you,1927.919,4.98,1930.409
it will never hurt again,1932.899,5.101,1935.4495
your life will be long,1935.72,5.459,1938.4495
the good things will be yours,1938.0,6.74,1941.37
the sun will shine for you,1941.179,3.561,1942.9595000000002

warning star,1970.34,2.959,1971.8194999999998
it's called shaving,2007.779,3.321,2009.4395
okay the white man had more hair on,2011.919,5.701,2014.7695
their faces than Indian so I cut it off,2014.799,5.701,2017.6495
instead of pulling hairs off,2017.62,4.5,2019.87
maybe you'd like to come closer and,2020.5,3.919,2022.4595
Don't Be Afraid sincere,2026.86,3.26,2028.49
right I'm not afraid,2034.299,5.22,2036.9089999999999

through this,2047.019,2.421,2048.2295
this is much better than looking in a,2051.04,4.579,2053.3295
pool of water,2053.02,2.599,2054.3195
and now I see you,2056.98,5.1,2059.53

only at ceremonies or in the dancing,2093.339,4.161,2095.4195
now I was told that Apache boys and,2099.099,4.381,2101.2895000000003
girls often pick those they want to,2101.8,3.72,2103.6600000000003

by accident,2135.82,2.66,2137.15
I walk this way because I don't know,2150.54,4.539,2152.8095

all my life I've been mostly alone I,2178.079,5.581,2180.8695000000002
wanted it that way,2180.88,2.78,2182.27
but when I saw you in the wiki up and,2183.7,3.78,2185.5899999999997
you touched me,2185.74,4.26,2187.87
and you prayed for me,2187.48,5.28,2190.12
I felt bad being alone,2190.0,4.38,2192.19
and I knew that I needed to see you,2192.76,3.72,2194.6200000000003
again before I left,2194.38,4.5,2196.63
so that I could find out if it was the,2196.48,3.57,2198.265
same as last night,2198.88,4.369,2201.0645
is it the same yes,2203.56,7.08,2207.1
so now when I go away,2207.119,5.921,2210.0795000000003
I'll be lonely for someone for the first,2210.64,5.12,2213.2
time in my life,2213.04,2.72,2214.4
I have decided about the mail,2237.88,5.58,2240.67
if I let the Riders go in safety but no,2240.72,3.82,2242.6299999999997
there will be no loss,2244.54,4.079,2246.5795
it will show the whites what power the,2246.76,4.62,2249.07
Apache has the idea makes me laugh a,2248.619,4.801,2251.0195000000003
little it is a good step,2251.38,4.02,2253.3900000000003
the seed is small maybe the tree will,2253.42,6.26,2256.55
grow big I'll be happy to tell my people,2255.4,4.28,2257.54
is it State Captain you saw Cochise,2261.88,4.5,2264.13
yourself I try,2264.339,4.26,2266.469
and a lad who would go to cochise's Camp,2266.38,4.979,2268.8695000000002
alone is some punkin of a man or a,2268.599,5.641,2271.4195
blasted liar I believe Captain jefford's,2271.359,3.781,2273.2495
the word of an Apache murder is,2275.14,4.08,2277.18
something else Cochise said the mail,2276.94,5.159,2279.5195
would ride safe I believe him while you,2279.22,4.139,2281.2895
were up there with him his Fighters,2282.099,2.821,2283.5095
attacked a wagon train just 40 miles,2283.359,3.961,2285.3395
east and killed every person in it now,2284.92,3.9,2286.87
the band attacked Pete kleiner's Ranch,2287.32,4.94,2289.79
and killed three men and a boy,2288.82,3.44,2290.54
Cochise never said anything about,2293.56,4.44,2295.7799999999997
calling off the war he just said the,2295.72,4.56,2298.0
mail was gone through well if you're so,2298.0,3.66,2299.83
full of faith in the word of an Indian,2300.28,3.839,2302.1995
will you lay a little bet on it you name,2301.66,5.52,2304.42
it will you lay three hundred dollars at,2304.119,5.161,2306.6995
five riders in succession leave here and,2307.18,5.0,2309.68
five come back,2309.28,2.9,2310.73
you got a bet,2312.579,3.141,2314.1495
males piled up no roots guaranteed set,2315.82,6.0,2318.82
but Tom Jeffords and his power coaches,2319.359,5.281,2321.9995
three days of riding in the sunshine at,2321.82,4.259,2323.9495
uh who's first,2326.079,3.081,2327.6195000000002
looks like you'll have to go yourself,2332.92,2.88,2334.36
only that won't prove a thing,2335.8,5.58,2338.59
that'll prove something,2341.38,3.08,2342.92
it's Duffy he's fat,2373.8,5.76,2376.6800000000003
see any Apaches a few smoke signals not,2394.92,6.64,2398.2400000000002
one live in me hi Mel all right Tom,2398.68,5.64,2401.5
why'd you take so long well if you want,2401.56,4.5,2403.81
the truth want to roll in safe and,2404.32,3.96,2406.3
fourth boy it got drunk took my time to,2406.06,4.14,2408.13
one got through Jeffers but there's,2410.2,4.139,2412.2695
another four to go I still think my,2412.119,6.081,2415.1595
BET's safe you want to double it,2414.339,3.861,2416.2695
a few days after Duffield returned we,2418.9,4.14,2420.9700000000003
sent out a second Rider he thought he,2420.88,3.78,2422.77
saw some Apaches trailing him but,2423.04,3.059,2424.5695
nothing happened,2424.66,2.76,2426.04
the third writer said it was that,2426.099,2.881,2427.5395000000003
peaceful on the trail he almost fell,2427.42,4.38,2429.61
asleep and when the fourth Rider went,2428.98,4.68,2431.32
out I was so proud of Cochise I was,2431.8,3.6,2433.6000000000004
ready to bust,2433.66,4.38,2435.85
the days passed quietly and on one of,2435.4,4.74,2437.77
those quiet days they started a wagon,2438.04,4.2,2440.14

Ambush a lot of Apaches to be hiding,2454.18,4.32,2456.3399999999997
over there I'm not only inviting Ambush,2456.099,5.341,2458.7695000000003

Amanda Laro says you are but why is,2818.619,4.561,2820.8995
Cochise so partial to you,2821.26,3.839,2823.1795
how come he lets this male Rider through,2823.18,3.179,2824.7695
on the same day he wipes out a whole,2825.099,3.0,2826.599
Wagon Train,2826.359,3.421,2828.0695
because he gave me his word and he's a,2828.099,4.26,2830.2290000000003

take me to see the Indian Cochise,2926.92,3.78,2928.81
I was told to see a Park New Mexico that,2928.78,3.539,2930.5495
you could do it if anybody could,2930.7,3.84,2932.62
I know you're angry you have reason to,2932.319,2.881,2933.7595
but I wish you'd sit down hear me out,2935.2,6.0,2938.2
you know light Army horses apparently,2938.56,4.44,2940.7799999999997
does this also Prejudice you against me,2941.2,4.139,2943.2695
it depends on how you're rated,2943.0,4.14,2945.07
the Bible I read preaches Brotherhood,2945.339,3.901,2947.2895
for all of God's children,2947.14,4.199,2949.2394999999997
suppose their skins aren't white are,2949.24,3.599,2951.0395
they still God's children,2951.339,3.061,2952.8695
my Bible says nothing about the,2952.839,4.52,2955.099
pigmentation of the skin,2954.4,2.959,2955.8795
there was a general served on her grad,2959.68,4.02,2961.69
who was called the Christian General yes,2961.66,3.6,2963.46
I've also been none among my soldiers is,2963.7,4.379,2965.8894999999998
Bible reading Howard,2965.26,4.8,2967.6600000000003

Washington President Grant is eager for,2989.74,3.96,2991.72
a fair peace with the Apaches what is a,2991.54,3.48,2993.2799999999997
fair piece,2993.7,5.28,2996.3399999999997
suppose you tell me equality the Apaches,2995.02,5.52,2997.78
are free people they have a right to,2998.98,3.66,3000.81
stay free on their own land you mean the,3000.54,4.98,3003.0299999999997

ruled by Apaches that's what I mean no,3010.56,4.62,3012.87
soldiers on it yes I'll agree to that in,3013.02,4.02,3015.03

trust me Cochise,3318.839,4.74,3321.209
there are Americans that I trust,3320.64,6.979,3324.1295
there are Indians that I would not trust,3323.579,4.04,3325.599
you should always wipe your hands on,3333.599,3.541,3335.3695000000002
your arms after eating taller the grease,3335.16,4.32,3337.3199999999997
is good for them among white men we wash,3337.14,4.87,3339.575
it off at a waste,3339.48,7.45,3343.205
my friend all evening your eyes have,3363.3,3.66,3365.13
gone to that same lady,3365.4,3.719,3367.2595
you must understand,3366.96,3.599,3368.7595
it's permitted for any man to be,3369.119,3.061,3370.6495
friendly with a woman whose husband is,3370.559,3.721,3372.4195
dead or who has ended their marriage,3372.18,4.04,3374.2
but not with the maiden likes on Siri,3374.28,5.09,3376.8250000000003
my this girl has been asked for already,3381.9,6.679,3385.2395
I think she will be married soon,3384.96,3.619,3386.7695
will be an insult not to go,3417.359,3.5,3419.109
we should not be seen together tall,3455.119,4.321,3457.2795
well if that is true why did you choose,3459.9,3.48,3461.64
me to dance with,3461.52,4.74,3463.89
I could not help,3463.38,4.439,3465.5995000000003
with me it's the same,3466.26,3.599,3468.0595000000003
I'll speak to your parents tonight no,3467.819,4.441,3470.0395
Tom it will cause deep trouble you must,3469.859,5.341,3472.5295
not it causes trouble already,3472.26,5.22,3474.8700000000003
you have not acted like my brother,3475.2,4.5,3477.45
this girl is a maiden at the campfire I,3477.48,3.3,3479.13
told you this and yet you walked away,3479.7,4.32,3481.8599999999997
with her coaches I want her for my wife,3480.78,5.279,3483.4195000000004
I will do all the things expected of a,3484.02,3.839,3485.9395
husband here,3486.059,6.621,3489.3695000000002
I refuse my Jose once I will again,3487.859,4.821,3490.2695
just the right way,3495.66,2.6,3496.96
it will not be easy for you,3499.079,5.101,3501.6295
you're an American,3502.14,4.8,3504.54
where will you live here,3504.18,4.62,3506.49
there will always be Apaches who have,3506.94,3.119,3508.4995
suffered from white men who will hate,3508.8,2.88,3510.2400000000002
you for it,3510.059,3.901,3512.0095
Busan Maybe,3511.68,4.139,3513.7495
will there not always be whites who will,3513.96,3.54,3515.73
hate your wife because of the color of,3515.819,4.04,3517.839
you will go far away me,3519.9,4.56,3522.1800000000003
in new places,3522.119,5.401,3524.8195
but your eyes will never see anything,3524.46,6.24,3527.58
always they will be turned backwards,3527.52,5.96,3530.5
or at home,3530.7,2.78,3532.0899999999997
and use on Siri,3534.72,5.22,3537.33
they will look at you as a strange,3537.66,3.899,3539.6095
and make jokes,3541.559,3.141,3543.1295
hear me Tony,3545.28,4.44,3547.5
I ask you to think on it,3547.2,5.46,3549.93
your way will be filled with bitterness,3549.72,4.859,3552.1495
is it not better to live with your own,3554.579,5.701,3557.4295
though you speak as my friend Cochise,3558.299,4.56,3560.579
nothing can change it,3560.28,5.339,3562.9495
I will marry some cra,3562.859,5.46,3565.589
what he says does not have to be you are,3565.619,5.341,3568.2895000000003
young you do not know,3568.319,5.04,3570.839
with him I do not tremble,3570.96,5.54,3573.73
even before you,3573.359,3.141,3574.9294999999997
I cannot say more against it,3578.46,4.98,3580.95
but it is still not easy,3581.52,3.839,3583.4395
her parents you will need the strongest,3583.44,3.72,3585.3
goal between you can find will you be my,3585.359,4.98,3587.8489999999997
go-between no other can do it,3587.16,5.399,3589.8595
I will speak for you tonight,3590.339,5.28,3592.979
otherwise it'll be worse,3592.559,6.06,3595.5890000000004
already everyone knows of this,3595.619,7.581,3599.4095
your secret was as quiet as the Thunder,3598.619,4.581,3600.9095
also I will speak to nailese,3603.839,4.921,3606.2995
he has bad luck,3606.96,5.04,3609.48
it has happened before to other men,3608.76,6.42,3611.9700000000003
you wait in your Wiki up maybe,3612.0,6.66,3615.33
one up and down,3615.18,7.28,3618.8199999999997
it is good for people in love,3618.66,3.8,3620.56
they refused,3645.66,2.959,3647.1394999999998
we'll take her away from here she'll go,3649.799,3.421,3651.5095
with me too,3651.359,4.681,3653.6994999999997
they did not refuse I make a joke that,3653.22,4.74,3655.5899999999997
is always a good joke,3656.04,4.14,3658.11
it is all arranged three horses and,3657.96,4.08,3660.0
Saddles to the parents good I'll bring,3660.18,4.26,3662.31

they're almost yours anyway,3668.54,6.34,3671.71
they come from your people,3672.24,4.859,3674.6695
I want to do this for you my friend,3674.88,4.08,3676.92
marriage will be at the next full moon,3677.099,4.681,3679.4395
or why so long await the girl's mother,3678.96,6.0,3681.96
decided it is her right,3681.78,4.86,3684.21

go to Tucson Look Into the Heart of his,3686.64,4.8,3689.04
General do not bring him back unless you,3689.28,3.42,3690.9900000000002
are sure of him,3691.44,3.78,3693.33
tomorrow I will send out Runners Apaches,3692.7,4.619,3695.0094999999997
from all tribes will come here,3695.22,4.02,3697.23
talk a piece is a big thing I cannot,3697.319,3.721,3699.1794999999997
decide it a lot,3699.24,5.24,3701.8599999999997
my people may not want it,3701.04,3.44,3702.7599999999998
I make no promises it is not expected,3706.22,6.16,3709.2999999999997
good sleep my brother,3710.579,5.121,3713.1395
remember no promises,3712.38,3.32,3714.04
I heard noise,3770.72,7.569,3774.5045
it's not your knife is an Apache knife,3778.799,4.28,3780.939
or attack someone who's been given,3798.859,4.661,3801.1895
safety here is forbidden,3801.359,3.901,3803.3095
it's a terrible wrong it cannot be,3803.52,2.38,3804.71
it's changed,3812.46,5.599,3815.2595
go to Tucson return in 10 days,3813.66,4.399,3815.8595
I ask you to forgive me that one of my,3818.819,4.481,3821.0595
people broke my word,3820.74,14.03,3827.7549999999997
the battle I have had no one like you,3835.26,7.68,3839.1000000000004
our lives were often mixed,3838.88,9.06,3843.4100000000003
at his end we've betrayed our people,3842.94,5.0,3845.44
I went back to Tucson and for a solid,3865.16,4.6,3867.46
week I studied and questioned General,3868.02,3.96,3870.0
Howard by the time I brought him back,3869.76,4.079,3871.7995
with me to the stronghold I knew why I'd,3871.98,4.16,3874.06
been nicknamed the Christian General,3873.839,4.921,3876.2995
I prayed that a decent peace would come,3876.14,4.719,3878.4995
from the meeting of these two men I,3878.76,4.68,3881.1000000000004
wanted it for my country I wanted it for,3880.859,5.341,3883.5295
Cochise and his people and I wanted it,3883.44,5.659,3886.2695
because I loved a girl,3886.2,5.94,3889.1699999999996
I'm told it is permitted to visit,3889.099,5.321,3891.7595
for a short time only,3892.14,5.34,3894.81
my mother is inside the Wikia,3894.42,6.199,3897.5195
you will sit there,3897.48,3.139,3899.0495
and I will keep sitting here,3904.4,6.899,3907.8495000000003
for we must not even touch our hands,3907.38,3.919,3909.3395
during the days I am very busy now,3911.76,6.12,3914.82
I prepare my clothes for the wedding,3914.819,5.941,3917.7895
I must build a special Wiki up for our,3917.88,4.32,3920.04
away from everybody,3922.2,6.44,3925.4199999999996
our honey moved out,3925.079,3.561,3926.8595
I must also build the wiki up we will,3929.4,3.54,3931.17
in all this my mother helps me and,3932.94,3.84,3934.86
teaches me,3935.22,4.74,3937.5899999999997
and I try to do is that I think she did,3936.78,6.059,3939.8095000000003
when she was a girl,3939.96,5.46,3942.69
and she couldn't have done it neither,3942.839,5.52,3945.599
what is that what does it mean well,3945.42,5.879,3948.3595
that's something Americans say,3948.359,5.581,3951.1495
it means that I love you,3951.299,4.661,3953.6295
not honor your parents,3953.94,8.86,3958.37
you understand Cochise about the signing,3963.38,4.719,3965.7395
of this map I will place my name upon,3965.94,5.159,3968.5195
yours Place Your Mark upon mine,3968.099,5.161,3970.6795
what is this signing this is a way of,3971.099,4.381,3973.2895000000003
showing to all people for all time any,3973.26,4.2,3975.36
agreement that you make this is as we,3975.48,3.359,3977.1595
agreed yesterday,3977.46,3.5,3979.21
you will explain it to the others,3978.839,2.461,3980.0695
the peace conference has been going on,3984.539,3.961,3986.5195000000003
for four days and now for the first time,3986.22,3.839,3988.1394999999998
we were asked to approach the meeting,3988.5,2.88,3989.94
we were finally face to face with the,3991.38,5.34,3994.05
most important man of the Apache tribes,3993.72,5.94,3996.6899999999996
they come from Arizona and New Mexico,3996.72,5.099,3999.2695
they would decide with Cochise whether,3999.66,4.939,4002.1295
there would be peace,4001.819,2.78,4003.209
my white brother will tell you something,4010.28,3.74,4012.15
I have in my hand here a map,4015.02,5.099,4017.5695
this is a sort of picture writing,4017.599,5.401,4020.2995
it shows the Apache territory 50 000,4020.119,5.101,4022.6695
square miles that you have agreed upon,4023.0,4.14,4025.07
now this piece of paper will go back to,4025.22,4.139,4027.2895
Washington for the chief of all the,4027.14,4.08,4029.18
white man lives,4029.359,4.68,4031.699
if you make a treaty of peace,4031.22,6.44,4034.4399999999996
this will be part of that treaty,4034.039,3.621,4035.8495000000003
if we make peace with the Americans can,4039.68,4.439,4041.8995
we still raid the Mexican there cannot,4042.02,4.799,4044.4195
be war against the Mexicans either,4044.119,4.801,4046.5195000000003
let the white eyes we will talk of this,4046.819,4.681,4049.1594999999998
by ourselves now is the time only for,4048.92,3.659,4050.7495
if the chief of the white man dies what,4052.579,3.96,4054.559
will follow,4054.859,3.841,4056.7795
his word is a bond on the chief who,4056.539,4.641,4058.8595
follows him,4058.7,2.48,4059.9399999999996
do others wish to speak,4061.819,4.321,4063.9795
I have a question,4063.92,4.56,4066.2000000000003
suppose some white man wants yellow iron,4066.14,4.62,4068.45
and he comes into our country to take it,4068.48,5.04,4071.0
can we kill him such a man shall be,4070.76,4.68,4073.1000000000004
captured and given to our military then,4073.52,4.86,4075.95
he will be judged and punished,4075.44,4.74,4077.81
supposedly will not let himself be,4078.38,3.36,4080.06
captured until he has killed one of my,4080.18,2.46,4081.41
if a white man kills an Indian on your,4082.64,5.58,4085.43
territory we will hang him,4084.74,5.52,4087.5
that will be something for Cochise to,4088.22,4.16,4090.2999999999997
you will go now,4099.259,4.881,4101.6995
I will bring you our decision,4100.819,3.321,4102.4795
I trust none of it four days ago we were,4112.04,4.199,4114.1395
given our territory on a piece of paper,4114.679,4.5,4116.929
today we cannot go into Mexico the,4116.239,5.1,4118.789
American General says no,4119.179,5.341,4121.8495
already our territory is smaller where,4121.339,5.641,4124.1595
will we get corn blankets horses if not,4124.52,4.08,4126.56
by taking them from the Mexican as we,4126.98,3.719,4128.839499999999
always have the American government will,4128.6,4.199,4130.699500000001
give us cattle we will raise them and,4130.699,4.56,4132.978999999999
trade them for our needs the answer of a,4132.799,4.581,4135.0895
I am not afraid I speak from my heart,4140.48,6.379,4143.6695
you you speak well speak more,4142.699,4.16,4144.7789999999995
it is not the Apache way to be,4147.14,4.079,4149.1795
grandmothers to cattle Cochise has lost,4148.88,3.959,4150.8595000000005
his taste for battle and so he is ready,4151.219,2.701,4152.5695
to surrender,4152.839,3.661,4154.6695
he throws away our victories it is not,4153.92,4.68,4156.26
this false peace we need but I Know,4156.5,4.46,4158.73
no I say this,4169.1,4.44,4171.320000000001
the Americans keep cattle but they are,4171.44,5.04,4173.96
not soft or weak,4173.54,4.86,4175.97
why shouldn't the Apache be able to,4176.48,3.6,4178.28
learn new ways,4178.4,3.839,4180.3195
it is not easy to change but sometimes,4180.08,4.8,4182.48
it is required,4182.239,5.58,4185.0289999999995
Americans are growing stronger,4184.88,6.0,4187.88
well we are growing weaker,4187.819,6.301,4190.9695
if a big wind comes a tree must Bend,4190.88,6.98,4194.37
or be lifted out by its roots,4194.12,3.74,4195.99
I will make a test of it for three moons,4213.739,4.161,4215.8195
I break the arrow,4221.659,5.721,4224.519499999999
I will try the way of peace,4223.64,3.74,4225.51
we'll give my word to the American,4230.6,3.66,4232.43
General tonight,4231.92,5.759,4234.7995
those who stay with me must keep my word,4234.26,5.399,4236.9595
let all others walk away,4237.679,5.181,4240.2695
they are no longer my brothers,4239.659,3.201,4241.259499999999
More Walk Away than stay,4244.699,7.261,4248.3295
and I will no longer be your chief,4248.36,6.56,4251.639999999999
I walk away,4251.96,2.96,4253.44
I walk away,4260.719,5.281,4263.3595000000005
I walk away,4263.239,5.841,4266.1595
I walk away,4266.0,3.08,4267.54
I walk away,4270.62,5.78,4273.51
I walk away,4273.38,3.02,4274.89
who else comes,4283.28,3.26,4284.91

I lead you my name also,4309.26,6.12,4312.320000000001
now I am ashamed to be a cheerokawa,4312.199,5.161,4314.7795
I will take the name Mexican enemies,4315.38,4.02,4317.39
they've given me the whites will learn,4317.36,4.56,4319.639999999999
it and you will earn it,4319.4,7.04,4322.92
from now on I am Geronimo,4321.92,4.52,4324.18
if Geronimo or his followers come to,4327.32,5.04,4329.84
this territory again,4329.9,5.839,4332.8195
let them come with weapons,4332.36,3.379,4334.0495
I'm worried they're taking a long time,4337.159,3.54,4338.929

Pony your honor Journal,4345.44,6.12,4348.5

a pony is a small horse General,4351.56,4.4,4353.76
we will try this piece,4370.76,4.32,4372.92
but there must be a waiting time but,4372.86,5.22,4375.469999999999
time for testing three moons why is it,4375.08,5.099,4377.6295
needed the white man has not shown in,4378.08,4.56,4380.36
the past that he will keep a peace,4380.179,5.851,4383.1045
three-month Armistice it's a good idea,4382.64,11.099,4388.1895
the first stone,4393.739,3.381,4395.429499999999
for every day without War there will be,4399.08,2.82,4400.49
three moons have passed the pile will be,4401.9,2.819,4403.309499999999
and we will place a white flag on it and,4404.719,5.221,4407.3295
there will be peace my heart is glad,4407.0,4.44,4409.22
I am not yet glad,4411.44,4.62,4413.75
to talk a piece is not hard,4413.84,5.06,4416.37
to live it is very hard,4416.06,7.34,4419.7300000000005
I will wait three moons to be glad,4418.9,4.5,4421.15
not everyone was happy about the Treaty,4423.64,4.36,4425.820000000001
there were those who still thought,4426.199,4.621,4428.509499999999
Cochise was a liar and a murderer,4428.0,4.62,4430.31
another could never be peace until he,4430.82,4.02,4432.83
was dead but the 90 days of the,4432.62,3.84,4434.54
Armistice began,4434.84,3.78,4436.7300000000005
I saw things unheard of things that,4436.46,3.98,4438.45

they'd become friends overnight but they,4447.02,4.94,4449.490000000001
didn't shoot,4449.54,2.42,4450.75

broken through the night,4873.98,5.54,4876.75
and listen to the Bells,4876.14,3.38,4877.83
it's as though they are singing in my,4879.98,2.95,4881.455
sixteen stones,4901.04,5.119,4903.5995
my white brother told me of the attack,4908.48,3.96,4910.459999999999

I'm afraid if I over my mouth I happen,4964.04,3.42,4965.75
rush out in a funny noise like,4967.46,11.219,4973.0695
the word that was made by Adam when he,4978.679,6.421,4981.8895
opened his eyes and saw Eve who are they,4980.719,6.421,4983.9295

they can I know so little,4990.739,3.621,4992.549499999999
when you grow tired of me and go back to,5001.36,4.26,5003.49

never think it again you are my people,5007.78,5.7,5010.63

I'll always remember the moments of,5017.08,3.48,5018.82
these days,5019.06,4.22,5021.17
we will remember,5020.56,2.72,5021.92
quiet of the nights we will talk of them,5024.159,5.241,5026.7795

The Boy Who Lies,5137.32,4.2,5139.42
I know this boy's father he's one of the,5141.52,4.32,5143.68
worst haters of the Apaches now if we,5144.04,3.42,5145.75

they talk your way with their tongues,5152.56,4.52,5154.820000000001
but not with their hearts,5154.12,2.96,5155.599999999999

if you're a child that you thought peace,5414.159,3.301,5415.809499999999
would come easy,5416.26,3.6,5418.06
you who taught me so well,5417.46,4.5,5419.71
is it my brother who asks me to spit on,5419.86,6.08,5422.9

you will hear me now,5435.04,3.84,5436.96
your bath is,5437.26,4.32,5439.42
this was not done by the military,5438.88,4.56,5441.16
Geronimo broke the piece no less than,5441.58,3.54,5443.35
these whites,5443.44,4.08,5445.48
as I bear the murder of my people so you,5445.12,4.92,5447.58
will bear the murder of your wife,5447.52,5.4,5450.22
I am Cochise I do not betray my people,5450.04,4.32,5452.2
or their children,5452.92,3.54,5454.6900000000005
no one on my territory will open War,5454.36,4.2,5456.46
not even you,5458.56,10.71,5463.915
I have given my permission they wanted,5481.08,4.24,5483.2
to see you,5483.82,3.98,5485.8099999999995
we've come to pay our respects Tom,5488.139,6.06,5491.169
I can help we've rounded up every man,5491.62,5.76,5494.5
that had anything to do with the ambush,5494.199,4.98,5496.688999999999
they're going to pay the full penalty,5497.38,4.319,5499.5395
for what they've done,5499.179,5.52,5501.939
nothing can compensate you but the,5505.06,3.599,5506.8595000000005
terrible thing that's happened,5506.92,3.36,5508.6
but your friends here are trying to tell,5508.659,3.06,5510.188999999999
you that your very loss has brought our,5510.28,3.6,5512.08
people together in the will to peace,5511.719,4.5,5513.969
without that will treaties are worth,5513.88,5.0,5516.38
little or nothing,5516.219,2.661,5517.5495
his words meant very little to me then,5520.96,5.4,5523.66
But as time passed I came to know that,5523.0,6.12,5526.06
the death of son Sierra put a seal on,5526.36,6.299,5529.5095
the peace and from that day on wherever,5529.12,6.48,5532.36
I went in the cities among the Apaches,5532.659,6.961,5536.139499999999
in the mountains I always remembered,5535.6,7.52,5539.360000000001
my wife was with me,5539.62,3.5,5541.37

it's an oldfashioned idea of is he he,3879.68,4.119,3881.7394999999997
believes it once a man has gone wrong,3882.16,5.08,3884.7
that's the end of it you don't agree,3883.799,7.081,3887.3395
no any man can make a mistake he he can,3887.24,5.68,3890.08
make lots of,3890.88,5.0,3893.38
mistakes but when he meets a woman and,3892.92,3.96,3894.9

believe it that men can change some men,3901.76,9.4,3906.46
yes I believe in it I told her to,3906.44,4.72,3908.8
Jeremy thanks,3912.039,6.201,3915.1395

married you you are getting married well,3951.559,4.921,3954.0195000000003
it looks that way what's the old man,3954.16,3.6,3955.96
about well he knows who you are or maybe,3957.76,5.64,3960.5800000000004
I should say he knows who you were does,3960.88,3.76,3962.76
he know who you,3963.4,5.959,3966.3795
were no what happens when he finds out,3964.64,7.12,3968.2
maybe by that time he find out I'm right,3969.359,4.601,3971.6594999999998
you're not right they won't let you,3971.76,4.359,3973.9395000000004
change that's why you're a fool to Lug,3973.96,3.92,3975.92
all this food to the settlement after,3976.119,4.121,3978.1795
you get it there what happens they pay,3977.88,4.52,3980.1400000000003
off with a big thank you a month later,3980.24,3.48,3981.9799999999996
they find out that you're the a clinic,3982.4,2.639,3983.7195
that used to right along the Missouri,3983.72,4.96,3986.2
border and then they kick you out maybe,3985.039,6.481,3988.2795
then why not take the stuff to the gold,3988.68,5.639,3991.4995
Camp what would you rather have a,3991.52,5.0,3994.02
"$100,000 or I thank you somebody will'll",3994.319,4.8,3996.719

weeks could be they won't take it,3999.119,5.72,4001.9790000000003
back if they don't I figure that's worth,4002.48,4.559,4004.7595
maybe then again maybe not,4012.039,6.161,4015.1195000000002
well any way you look at it it's,4016.279,4.161,4018.3595

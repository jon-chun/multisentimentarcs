or are you interested in my well-being?",2207.542,3.993,2209.5385
I'm interested in my business.,2211.667,1.831,2212.5825
"I want this game finished,
so I can get started.",2213.625,2.491,2214.8705
"- Play, Annie.
- Eight of diamonds.",2216.25,1.956,2217.228
"Why are you going
on this manhunt with Bravo?",2218.333,2.787,2219.7265
Always help a fellow officer of the law.,2221.25,2.412,2222.456
That's not your reason.,2223.792,1.991,2224.7875
"Maybe I just like to ride
up in the hills away from people.",2226.958,3.822,2228.869
"I'll be waiting at your office, Bravo.",2230.917,2.241,2232.0375
"- Eight of spades.
- Nine of spades. Ten of spades.",2234.167,4.118,2236.226
"Oh, shucks!",2242.292,1.956,2243.27
"- Where are you going, Rita?
- If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.",2246.458,3.993,2248.4545000000003
"To preserve law and order to the best
of your ability as Deputy Sheriff.",2254.792,4.164,2256.874
"- You're wanted inside.
- Me?",2262.042,2.286,2263.185
"- Rita...
- Dan.",2275.625,1.911,2276.5805
I want to say goodbye.,2279.542,2.082,2280.583
"- Well...
- Don't say anything.",2281.75,1.991,2282.7455
You big idiot! Oh!,2288.75,2.286,2289.893
"- Open this door!
- Take care of yourself, Rita.",2294.75,2.662,2296.081
"I'll pick up that holding business
when I get back.",2297.542,2.833,2298.9584999999997
"Dan, you will let me out of here!",2300.5,1.991,2301.4955
"Good idea, but it didn't work.
Let her out in ten minutes.",2309.833,3.197,2311.4315
"- Ready, Dan?
- Coming, Bravo.",2313.167,1.991,2314.1625
"- Sun's up.
- Oh.",2365.083,1.991,2366.0785
Could use a little help around here.,2372.0,2.082,2373.041
"You got three deputies.
What more do you want?",2374.208,2.537,2375.4765
"Had three deputies.
Pulled out on us last night.",2376.875,2.992,2378.371
You mean them polecats hightailed it?,2381.042,2.207,2382.1455
"About 3am. They didn't make too much
noise. I went right back to sleep.",2383.375,4.494,2385.622
"If you seen 'em go,
why didn't you stop 'em?",2388.0,2.491,2389.2455
"Wouldn't have been much use to us.
Their hearts weren't in it.",2390.625,3.822,2392.536
"Maybe you and me better get
out of here, too.",2395.5,2.491,2396.7455
Ain't much two of us can do.,2398.125,1.991,2399.1205
Only takes one man to catch Jet.,2400.25,1.991,2401.2455
"Last night, before I went to sleep,
I did a lot of thinking.",2414.208,3.913,2416.1645
About what?,2418.25,1.831,2419.1655
"Jet Younger, this fire, how far it could
be seen from up there in the hills.",2420.208,4.79,2422.603
"What are you trying to say, Dan?",2426.042,1.991,2427.0375
"If the idea of this expedition was
to warn Jet we were comin',",2428.167,3.413,2429.8734999999997
"so he could stay out of our way,
this is the place to build a fire.",2431.708,3.492,2433.454
"Shucks!
You're just jumpin' to conclusions.",2435.333,2.616,2436.641
"Maybe so. The first one is that Jet
is probably where he can see this fire.",2438.083,4.414,2440.29
"Makes me remember there's an old line
shack up there. Be a comfortable hideout.",2442.625,4.573,2444.9115
"- Look here, Dan...
- Better mix up some biscuits.",2447.333,2.867,2448.7665
Are you...,2450.333,1.991,2451.3285
"- Well, I figure we better be on our way.
- Which way?",2466.0,3.538,2467.769
"We'll turn back towards town,
look up them deputies first thing.",2469.667,3.663,2471.4984999999997
What about the line shack?,2473.458,2.082,2474.4990000000003
"Now, Dan, I'm in charge of this party
and I say we go the other way.",2475.667,3.743,2477.5385
"I think I'll take a ride
towards the line shack.",2480.458,2.992,2481.954
You sure are a stubborn critter.,2496.125,2.241,2497.2455
"I didn't hurt you, did I, Dan?",2502.042,2.207,2503.1455
"I did it for your own good, son.",2506.583,1.991,2507.5785
"I couldn't stand
to see you get yourself shot up.",2508.708,3.072,2510.244
"Oh, what do we care about them
homesteaders or Jet Younger or anybody?",2512.833,4.994,2515.33
"Are you all right, Dan?",2522.542,1.991,2523.5375
"I'd rather have taken
the conk on my own head, son.",2532.75,3.163,2534.3315
"There's no sense
in a man being so stubborn.",2538.792,2.833,2540.2084999999997
I'll be back tonight to let you loose.,2547.458,2.537,2548.7265
The rest'll do you good.,2550.125,1.991,2551.1205
"Don't you go and make me look for you.
You stay right here.",2553.958,3.538,2555.727
"Poor fella. I hope
the ants don't crawl all over him.",2603.75,3.993,2605.7465
"Why, that sneakin', no good...",2621.667,1.991,2622.6625
I better get outta here!,2623.792,1.991,2624.7875
Oh... oh...,2667.667,2.116,2668.725
"Catched him, didn't you?",2670.792,2.616,2672.1
"Hot today, ain't it?",2678.292,2.616,2679.6
"Might rain before the end of the week,
though.",2681.042,2.992,2682.538
"- Go away!
- Got any drinking water?",2684.167,2.992,2685.663
"Yeah. Plenty of it in the well.
You and your friend come on up.",2687.292,3.618,2689.101
"- He ain't no friend of mine.
- Sure we're friends. Do this every day.",2691.042,4.039,2693.0615
"Come on, friend.",2695.208,1.991,2696.2035
Supposing I play a jack? What happens?,2702.375,3.413,2704.0815
"That all depends.
One of the first rules of the game...",2705.917,4.619,2708.2264999999998
"Might be more profitable for you
to wait for me here, Bravo.",2710.667,3.993,2712.6635
"Oh, I'll just play a little bit. Maybe
show him something about the game.",2714.792,4.949,2717.2664999999997
"- Give me your word you'll stay here.
- Did a horse ever run away from oats?",2719.875,4.824,2722.287
"Well, uh...",2731.125,2.582,2732.416
Let's see.,2733.833,2.036,2734.851
Let's deal again.,2740.0,2.616,2741.308
Need a little grease in that skillet.,2776.542,2.833,2777.9584999999997
"I wouldn't do that, Jet.",2782.083,2.412,2783.289
What do you want?,2784.625,2.366,2785.808
"- A little of your time. About 20 years.
- Charlie Fair said that...",2787.125,4.994,2789.622
"Bravo would camp where you could see his
fire, then go in the opposite direction.",2792.25,4.619,2794.5595
That right?,2797.0,2.286,2798.143
"I don't know what you're talking about.
Where is Bravo?",2799.417,4.198,2801.516
"Busy. Come on, Jet.
Let's start for town.",2803.75,3.413,2805.4565
"I don't get this. You're not Sheriff.
You're Town Marshal.",2807.292,4.619,2809.6014999999998
"- What do you want out of this deal?
- Security for my children.",2812.042,4.198,2814.141
"- You ain't got any children.
- Some day I might. Ready, Jet?",2816.375,4.744,2818.747
Better take my coat. It's cold out.,2826.708,2.491,2827.9535
"All right, Jet.",2869.5,2.241,2870.6205
"- You'd better shoot. I'm not going.
- You're going.",2871.875,3.743,2873.7465
"Tied across the saddle,
kicking and scratching.",2875.75,3.413,2877.4565
"Have to bring you back alive, Jet.",2879.292,1.991,2880.2875
"Got to prove you're not tough to get.
That's important to me.",2881.417,3.413,2883.1234999999997
"Queen of diamonds, king of diamonds.
And out.",2935.333,3.993,2937.3295000000003
Finished that game yet?,2944.833,2.833,2946.2495
That makes $ 14 and 70 cents you owe me.,2951.833,2.787,2953.2265
Don't bother me with petty details.,2954.75,2.491,2955.9955
"- Brought you a present.
- Another friend of you fellas?",2961.375,3.618,2963.184
"- What have I got to do with him?
- He's your prisoner.",2965.125,2.992,2966.621
"- Can he play fan-tan?
- Shut up!",2968.25,2.992,2969.746
"Now, Dan, foolin' is foolin',
but this has took on a serious turn.",2971.375,3.993,2973.3715

with a murderer across your saddle?",2977.833,4.699,2980.1825
"Hey, Ed. Come here.",2995.917,2.833,2997.3334999999997
"Bravo Trimble, did you catch him?",3017.625,2.491,3018.8705
"- You see him, don't you?
- Three cheers for Sheriff Trimble!",3020.25,4.198,3022.349
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!,3024.583,2.286,3025.726
"Thanks, folks. I was just doin' my duty.",3027.0,2.992,3028.496
"- Get me inside, you big four-flusher!
- He put up quite a fight, Jet did.",3030.125,4.414,3032.332
"- Dan, I'm so terribly glad you're back.
- So am I.",3035.667,4.039,3037.6865
Hooray! Hooray!,3039.833,2.833,3041.2495
"When I was a child
I burned my finger",3048.042,5.074,3050.5789999999997
And it taught me not to play with fire,3053.292,3.868,3055.226
"Don't know why
this lesson didn't linger",3058.167,4.744,3060.5389999999998
Here this foolish heart of mine,3063.042,3.538,3064.8109999999997
Has burned its finger many times,3066.708,4.414,3068.915
"But still
it doesn't lessen my desire",3071.25,7.156,3074.828

I know that it's the last,3086.417,4.619,3088.7264999999998

"Well, maybe next time",3098.25,3.197,3099.8485

I'm back where I began,3106.958,3.618,3108.7670000000003
Just another also-ran,3111.583,4.494,3113.83
But maybe next time,3116.208,3.117,3117.7665
I've waited long for this romance,3122.542,4.619,3124.8514999999998
And when we met my heart was lost,3127.292,5.324,3129.9539999999997
With you I think I stand a chance,3132.75,4.414,3134.957
But just the same,3137.292,3.367,3138.9755
I've got my fingers crossed,3141.667,4.448,3143.891
Every time I give my heart,3147.583,4.619,3149.8925
"For instance, like with you",3152.333,4.323,3154.4945000000002
That for we two,3159.75,4.414,3161.957
There'll be no next time.,3164.292,6.2,3167.392
"- Odds any better now?
- No change.",3178.083,3.822,3179.994
I promised to pick up where we left off.,3212.125,2.616,3213.433

that you're so sure of yourself.",3214.875,4.573,3217.1615
"When a man rides down the middle of
Texas Street, confidence is all he's got.",3219.583,3.993,3221.5795000000003

I think you've made a bad investment.",3232.25,3.413,3233.9565
"Let's wait and see. And now if you've
found out everything you want to know,",3235.792,4.619,3238.1014999999998

- I haven't found out anything.",3240.542,4.494,3242.7889999999998
"You've got a screen. Change.
I feel like talking.",3245.167,3.993,3247.1635
"Come to think of it,
it's the screen around you I don't like.",3259.083,4.824,3261.495
Hand me the dress on that chair.,3264.042,2.207,3265.1455
"And the porcupine quills you shoot out
to keep people away from you.",3268.458,4.699,3270.8075
"Why, no man who's walked or ridden
into this town has ever gotten near you.",3273.292,4.949,3275.7664999999997
"- What you need is a ride in the hills.
- I don't mix my drinks.",3286.667,4.744,3289.0389999999998
You're scared.,3293.25,1.991,3294.2455
"Trying to be tough because you're scared
and scared because you're warm and soft.",3299.667,5.074,3302.2039999999997
I'll lock my door after this.,3306.458,2.582,3307.7490000000003
"Better use up some of that
before it spoils.",3315.417,3.993,3317.4135
"I knew you'd do that. I let you stay to
find out if you were like every other man.",3321.25,5.415,3323.9575

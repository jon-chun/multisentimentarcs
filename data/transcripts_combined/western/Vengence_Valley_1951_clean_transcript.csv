I got a story to tell.,57.425,1.25,58.05
A yarn about cow country and cow punchers.,59.383,2.292,60.529
Cattle and men.,62.133,1.042,62.654
"I was working for the Strobie Ranch
learning my trade.",63.966,2.709,65.3205
"Trade of worn leather,
saddle blisters and branding irons.",67.175,2.958,68.654
"Trade with some song,
some fun and some luck.",71.008,2.5,72.258
"It was as good a job
as a man could ask for.",74.841,2.167,75.9245
"Lonely, sometimes cold.",78.008,1.583,78.7995
"So much distance,
you thought you'd never get back,",79.925,2.5,81.175
"but for me, a young kid,
it was a fine time.",83.633,2.167,84.7165
Memories are mostly good.,86.55,1.333,87.2165
"You're up there on top of the world,
where the air was clear and thin.",89.008,3.583,90.7995
The only sound was the wind in the pines.,93.341,2.375,94.5285
We were in the business of growing beef.,96.925,2.0,97.925
"Always moving the cattle
and looking for new feed.",99.133,2.5,100.383
They were those new bald-faced heifers.,103.3,2.166,104.383
"Not like the longhorns,
wild and spooky but friendly critters.",105.55,4.333,107.7165
Gentle as a dog.,110.466,1.209,111.0705
Seasons melted away peacefully,112.966,2.125,114.0285
"from spring to summer, fall, then winter.",115.175,3.708,117.029
"Cows had to look out
for themselves in the snow.",119.8,2.375,120.9875
The winter drift.,122.842,1.0,123.342
"Soon as a man on horseback
could get around,",125.382,2.125,126.4445
they'd go out and locate the cattle.,127.592,1.833,128.5085
Spot them for the spring roundup.,130.092,1.665,130.92450000000002
"They'd come back
from the winter drift cold and worn out.",133.092,2.833,134.50850000000003
Our foreman was Owen Daybright.,138.05,1.582,138.841
He knew what he was doing.,140.132,1.335,140.7995
We all liked him.,141.925,1.0,142.425
There was his foster brother Lee Strobie.,144.507,2.085,145.5495
Their father owned the ranch.,147.882,1.46,148.612
"The night they got back,
the trouble began.",149.925,2.125,150.9875
"Well, look what's turned up.",152.342,1.5,153.092
"Hiya, Cal.",153.967,1.0,154.467
People still drink whiskey.,155.175,1.375,155.8625
"-Hiya, Lee.
-Beat down to my shoes.",156.842,2.083,157.88350000000003
"That's what comes from working for someone
you've known too long, Lee.",159.3,3.457,161.0285
Seen my wife this winter?,167.717,1.125,168.2795
"Jen comes into town
a couple of times with your old man.",168.925,2.75,170.3
How'd Arch look?,171.925,1.0,172.425
"Oh, just fair, I'd say.
Cold weather always seems to bother him.",173.007,3.25,174.632
How'd Jen look?,176.592,1.0,177.092
"The way to find that out
is go home and see for yourself.",178.132,2.835,179.5495
"-Yes.
-Can I borrow your razor, Cal?",181.05,1.707,181.9035
"-I don't want to scare her.
-In the back.",182.842,1.915,183.79950000000002
"-Keeping you busy, Doc?
-A night doesn't go by…",185.092,1.75,185.967
They've been trying to get him all-day,186.925,1.542,187.696
"for that girl who used to work
at the Eaton house.",188.55,2.457,189.7785
I wouldn't know her name.,193.925,1.292,194.571
"What's her trouble, Doc?",198.342,1.208,198.94600000000003
"Oh, small variety.",199.842,1.665,200.67450000000002
About that big.,202.217,1.04,202.73700000000002
"Arrived a couple of hours ago,
they tell me.",203.757,2.168,204.841
"-You wouldn't go?
-That's right.",208.217,1.958,209.19600000000003
"I don't take calls like this
until I hear from the father,",210.757,2.918,212.216
and that isn't likely.,214.717,1.125,215.2795
"There's a rifle on you, cowboy.",227.967,1.583,228.75850000000003
"Get down and walk over here
so I can see who you are.",231.507,2.418,232.716
Get down now!,235.507,1.0,236.007
"-Owen, is that you?
-Yes.",242.882,3.125,244.4445
Put that gun down.,247.55,1.0,248.05
He's a friend.,248.882,1.0,249.382
"-What are you doing here?
-Helping.",263.216,2.0,264.216
Nobody else would come.,266.258,1.167,266.8415
So I heard.,267.841,1.0,268.341
How's Lee?,270.05,1.0,270.55
He wants to see you.,272.466,1.0,272.966
I'll be home as soon as she's asleep.,274.05,1.875,274.9875
Her brother Dick Fasken from out of town.,281.425,2.083,282.4665
He spent the day looking for the man.,284.633,1.875,285.5705
Is Lily all right?,288.05,1.0,288.55
"You've got company, Lily.",295.3,1.25,295.925
"-Hello, Owen.
-Lily.",304.091,1.209,304.6955
And beautiful.,313.966,1.0,314.466
"Good color, too.",316.258,1.0,316.758
The doctor wouldn't come.,323.175,1.25,323.8
Jen came instead.,325.966,1.084,326.508
"Don't even think about it, Lily.",327.8,1.625,328.6125
"I'm really pretty lucky, Owen.",331.591,1.625,332.4035
"I couldn't face up
going back to the restaurant to work.",335.05,2.75,336.425
"Mrs. Burke offered us work
at her place when I'm ready for it.",339.341,3.209,340.9455
"We're grateful, too.",344.591,1.0,345.091
"It sounds queer to say it here and now,
but he'll have a good life, Owen.",346.758,4.958,349.23699999999997
"I'm sure he will, Lily.",354.175,1.166,354.75800000000004
I'm sure he will.,357.925,1.0,358.425
"You've seen me before, Owen.",394.55,1.416,395.25800000000004
There's been a change.,396.341,1.125,396.9035
"Somebody washed your face
and got you a new dress.",397.675,2.25,398.8
"Arch, and a tub in my own room.",400.008,2.458,401.23699999999997
I bathe every day now.,403.05,1.125,403.6125
It's an improvement.,405.425,1.0,405.925
How was the winter?,408.466,1.0,408.966
"Well, we stayed alive,
and we kept the cattle alive.",410.883,2.583,412.17449999999997
It was snowing at the ranch.,413.8,1.416,414.50800000000004
"I didn't see our nearest neighbor
in nearly five weeks.",415.508,2.75,416.883
"We missed you, Owen.",420.3,1.0,420.8
I brought Lily some grub.,428.05,1.25,428.675
Who was it?,433.466,1.0,433.966
"Goodnight, Jen.",437.008,1.0,437.508
Hold it a minute.,443.55,1.0,444.05
"-Do you live in these parts?
-Around here.",450.091,2.0,451.091
Who's the father?,453.383,1.0,453.883
That'd be Lily's business.,456.175,1.375,456.8625
"-I'll find out.
-Sure.",457.8,1.25,458.425
"-I'll find out if it takes me a lifetime.
-Fine.",459.758,2.25,460.883
It's a nice country to live in.,462.633,1.583,463.42449999999997
Who was that?,489.341,1.0,489.841
Owen Daybright.,492.133,1.0,492.633
"-Your husband's foster brother, isn't he?
-That's right.",494.716,2.75,496.091
"He brought this food, too.",503.383,1.333,504.04949999999997
You're wrong.,508.216,1.0,508.716
"He's good, and there's no one else
around here like him.",509.757,3.167,511.3405
"Yes, he keeps his ace as a kicker,
and he draws to it every time.",521.966,3.417,523.6745
"-Three times.
-Mr. Kicker.",525.55,2.083,526.5915
"It's a game of chance, boys.",528.425,1.416,529.1329999999999
We'll play again sometime.,534.591,1.334,535.258
"-I ran your errand.
-Thanks, Owen.",544.425,2.166,545.5079999999999
It's paid for like you pay for a coat.,547.716,2.459,548.9455
I appreciate it.,550.675,1.0,551.175
It isn't the first time you saved my hide.,552.258,2.125,553.3205
"Why don't you grow up, boy?",555.8,1.375,556.4875
"Look, it happens.",557.966,1.459,558.6955
I sleep well.,559.966,1.0,560.466
Your wife was there.,563.55,1.0,564.05
Does she have any idea?,565.216,1.167,565.7995
It happened before I met Jen.,570.633,1.5,571.383
"Even so, she wouldn't understand it,
you know what she's like.",572.883,2.708,574.2370000000001
Why should I know what she's like?,576.008,1.708,576.8620000000001
"That's right, you don't.",578.175,1.208,578.779
She's what all the others weren't.,580.8,1.708,581.654
She's everything I ever wanted for myself.,583.508,2.167,584.5915
"It's been a long time,
let's get back to the ranch.",587.925,2.041,588.9454999999999
"Stop right there, Daybright.",591.133,1.417,591.8415
"You, move away.",592.841,1.0,593.341
You brought Lily $500.,601.008,1.375,601.6955
That's right.,606.8,1.0,607.3
Doesn't she need it?,608.466,1.0,608.966
Not that kind.,610.133,1.0,610.633
"That wasn't grub money,
it was get-out-of-town money.",611.633,2.542,612.904
I'll ask you one time.,615.55,1.125,616.1125
Was it yours?,617.8,1.0,618.3
"Point that gun to the floor, Son,
and turn around.",619.216,2.459,620.4455
They'll be other times.,630.55,1.166,631.1329999999999
"You're a conclusion jumper,
and I don't like them.",632.05,2.166,633.1329999999999
"-Quit it, Owen.
-I'll handle this myself, Con.",634.3,2.166,635.3829999999999
Not as long as I'm the sheriff.,636.55,1.583,637.3415
"All right, Con.",639.716,1.0,640.216
You've scared me twice tonight.,644.3,1.583,645.0915
"Next time you point a gun at me, shoot it.",646.05,2.125,647.1125
"Well, welcome home, boys.",692.425,2.125,693.4875
"-How are you, Arch?
-You look fit, Son.",694.633,1.833,695.5495000000001
"-How are you, Owen?
-Good.",696.591,1.209,697.1955
"-How's the leg?
-It's got the misery.",697.883,1.625,698.6955
Same as every winter for 20 years.,699.591,1.792,700.487
"-Evening, boys.
-Hello, Mr. Willoughby.",701.508,2.0,702.508
"I thought you might want
some hot coffee, Arch.",703.841,1.959,704.8205
"Well, thank you, Mr. Willoughby.",705.883,1.667,706.7165
Same old dishwater?,708.258,1.042,708.779
"-You don't want any, huh?
-Oh, no, I was just kidding.",711.216,2.584,712.508
"-Then watch your language.
-How's the bad stomach?",714.633,2.375,715.8205
"Owen, some days I doubt
if I'll make it to sundown.",717.716,3.917,719.6745
"Why don't you stop
eating your own cooking?",721.716,2.125,722.7785
"Oh, I'm stuck here, I can't help it.",724.008,2.375,725.1955
"Arch, these cigars aren't from Pittsburgh.",732.716,2.125,733.7785
Kansas City.,734.966,1.0,735.466
The place sure is going downhill fast.,738.758,2.25,739.883
How'd it go?,743.8,1.0,744.3
Ask the foreman.,745.925,1.0,746.425
I just took orders.,747.3,1.083,747.8415
You got a wife waiting for you.,750.633,1.583,751.4245000000001
I hadn't forgotten.,752.716,1.0,753.216
I'll look in on her.,755.8,1.0,756.3
"-Goodnight.
-Goodnight, Son.",758.591,1.375,759.2785
"Goodnight, Lee.",760.05,1.0,760.55
The boy looks trim.,762.633,1.042,763.154
Nobody could've worked harder this winter.,765.508,2.0,766.508
He's got a lot to make up for.,767.675,1.5,768.425
He'll come around.,770.716,1.0,771.216
Maybe Jen has something to do with it.,772.216,1.917,773.1745
"Anyway, he can handle it alone now.",775.258,1.75,776.133
"Well,
It sounds like you're giving notice, Owen.",777.425,3.041,778.9454999999999
Lee's married now.,782.3,1.0,782.8
Jen's a fine daughter for you.,784.05,1.5,784.8
I'm just crowding the place.,786.091,1.417,786.7995
"-Oh, if you're not comfortable here…
-I'm not forgetting, Arch.",787.591,3.084,789.133
"You've done all you could
to make me belong.",790.925,1.666,791.7579999999999
"When you picked me up,
I was just a stray orphan,",792.675,3.208,794.279
"foul-mouthed and flea-bitten,
15 years ago.",796.091,2.167,797.1745
"It's been a long time, a good time.",799.008,1.75,799.883
Now It's time for me to go.,801.8,1.375,802.4875
You really mean it.,804.591,1.0,805.091
"Well, I want to push on
and try my own wings.",806.55,2.208,807.654
How do I say this?,812.633,1.458,813.3620000000001
"When I took you, it was for Lee.",816.05,1.958,817.029
"I couldn't get around outside
and raise my own boy,",818.716,2.667,820.0495
so I picked you to do it for me.,821.466,1.667,822.2995
"What I didn't know then
was that I needed you, too.",823.3,3.541,825.0704999999999
I need you now.,828.508,1.0,829.008
"All right, Arch.",836.341,1.0,836.841
"I was hinting at you for a raise, anyhow.",840.925,2.083,841.9665
"-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.",845.841,1.125,846.4035
"Jen, will you hurry up and come on out?",849.55,1.958,850.529
"I don't know why, all of a sudden,
you can't get dressed in front of me.",854.258,3.125,855.8205
"I'll be two more minutes, Lee.",857.466,1.5,858.216
"On top of all winter, that's a long time.",860.05,2.083,861.0915
I know that better than you.,862.341,2.25,863.466
You mean you've missed me?,867.258,1.333,867.9245000000001
Of course.,869.05,1.041,869.5704999999999
You're beautiful.,883.05,1.0,883.55
"Do you think so, Lee?",884.883,1.083,885.4245000000001
Do you really mean it?,887.216,1.125,887.7785
"The first time I saw you,
you were wearing a pair of split britches.",889.008,3.375,890.6955
You helped me come out of the backcountry.,894.008,2.125,895.0705
You and Arch.,896.425,1.0,896.925
"This is the second Sunday dress
I ever owned, Lee.",899.133,2.75,900.508
"The first one I wore
to my mother's funeral.",902.966,2.167,904.0495
"Then I used it to bury my father,
then I burned it.",905.258,3.167,906.8415
"Now you're a lady of fashion, huh?",910.8,1.791,911.6954999999999
"Well, that's what it says
in Godey's Lady's Book.",915.091,2.792,916.487
"I haven't done
many smart things in my life,",923.008,2.208,924.1120000000001
but marrying you is one of them.,925.758,1.625,926.5705
"We'll be happy, Lee.",928.341,1.042,928.862
"Nothing can stop us, honey.",930.258,1.542,931.029
Check in to the last call!,944.758,1.417,945.4665
Where have you been?,957.966,1.042,958.487
"-Morning, Mr. Willoughby.
-Morning, Owen.",960.633,2.167,961.7165
Nice to see a real man back again.,963.175,1.958,964.154

"Good morning, real man.",966.925,1.541,967.6954999999999
"That nasty old noise woke you up,",968.55,1.833,969.4665
"or were you waiting for the sun
to hit your dimpled cheeks?",970.466,2.792,971.862
"You Sunday men
haven't lost any sleep in so long",973.925,2.666,975.2579999999999
you've forgotten what you go to bed for.,976.675,2.0,977.675
Mr. Willoughby's buttering the foreman.,978.758,2.0,979.758
"All right, all right, I slept late.",982.133,2.125,983.1955
"Why is it that when a man's out
on the range alone and eating his cooking,",984.341,2.917,985.7995

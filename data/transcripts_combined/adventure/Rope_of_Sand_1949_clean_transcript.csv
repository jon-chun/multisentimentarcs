why don't you go sell your rug someplace,1498.919,3.681,1500.7595000000001
else heard a curious story the other day,1505.399,6.601,1508.6995
Mr Davis it's about a young man a a,1508.039,5.52,1510.799
hunter who used to make his living,1512.0,4.88,1514.44
around here as a guide until um until he,1513.559,6.36,1516.739
got into trouble what kind of trouble oh,1516.88,5.039,1519.3995000000002
it seems he took an impetuous gentleman,1519.919,4.48,1522.159
somewhat beyond the main Hunting Party,1521.919,4.961,1524.3995
this gentleman he he was obsessed by one,1524.399,5.561,1527.1795
idea he wanted to shoot a line so one,1526.88,5.56,1529.66
night they they camped quite near to a,1529.96,4.56,1532.24
prohibited area and and to amuse the,1532.44,3.92,1534.4
gentleman he started to tell him some of,1534.52,4.72,1536.8799999999999
the tales of the prohibited Diamond area,1536.36,5.88,1539.3
perhaps the one about the,1539.24,5.48,1541.98
clerk you know the clerk that made a,1542.24,4.799,1544.6395
quick Dash past a Baran scooped up a,1544.72,5.24,1547.34
busho of diamonds they're lying only a,1547.039,4.52,1549.299
few inches under the,1549.96,4.76,1552.3400000000001
sand and he fled to Angola and from,1551.559,4.801,1553.9595
there to England and there he's supposed,1554.72,4.12,1556.78
to be living now like a fabulous,1556.36,5.319,1559.0194999999999
friends at any rate in the morning when,1558.84,6.28,1561.98
a guide woke up his gentleman was gone,1561.679,6.521,1564.9395000000002
pasted a Barian into a prohibited,1565.12,5.919,1568.0794999999998
area is this,1568.2,4.88,1570.64
interesting it's,1571.039,5.88,1573.979
interesting yes well eventually he found,1573.08,4.76,1575.46
Delirious fantastic as it sounds,1577.84,5.64,1580.6599999999999
wallowing but wallowing in a virtual bed,1580.559,4.761,1582.9395
diamonds he got him back but the two,1585.32,4.0,1587.32
fell into the hands of the diamond,1587.76,4.919,1590.2195
police and the impetuous gentleman who,1589.32,6.479,1592.5594999999998
so badly wanted to shoot a lion died,1592.679,5.081,1595.2195000000002
incoherently poor,1597.76,6.88,1601.2
gentleman what happened to the GU H,1600.76,7.72,1604.62
oh he was badly beaten by the police and,1604.64,5.72,1607.5
then he was released after a time and,1608.48,3.64,1610.3
packing but apparently he has never,1612.12,5.76,1615.0
disclosed the location of the diamonds,1615.279,4.4,1617.479
curious part about the story as it was,1617.88,4.279,1620.0195
told to me is that this young man this,1619.679,4.521,1621.9395000000002
this guy he's supposed to be raty and,1622.159,5.361,1624.8395
Diamond at this very moment his purpose,1624.2,5.28,1626.8400000000001
of course you can easily,1627.52,6.0,1630.52
guess have you ever done any hunting Mr,1629.48,6.96,1632.96
Davis once or,1633.52,6.879,1636.9595
twice I was only thinking if uh if you,1636.44,6.479,1639.6795
ever meet this young man this guide you,1640.399,5.081,1642.9395
might deliver a message for me saying,1642.919,6.841,1646.3395
what oh saying uh saying that I'm here,1645.48,6.559,1648.7595000000001
free as the wind Fountain of,1649.76,4.56,1652.04
extraordinary knowledge splendidly,1652.039,5.961,1655.0194999999999
corrupt and eager to be of profitable,1654.32,6.56,1657.6
service where would he find you that,1658.0,5.64,1660.82
wouldn't be,1660.88,6.279,1664.0195
difficult never heard of,1663.64,3.519,1665.3995
uh if you excuse me please you see they,1673.64,6.519,1676.8995
and I we slightly disagree about a man's,1677.919,4.841,1680.3395
privilege to to occasionally sell or buy,1680.159,3.841,1682.0795
a few little,1682.76,5.0,1685.26
diamonds until we meet,1684.0,3.76,1685.88
again good luck keep out of the drive,1690.679,7.281,1694.3195
after you sir don't be so rude don't,1694.64,5.759,1697.5195

a thousand has all been assembled with,2478.2,3.919,2480.1594999999998
care there's only one thing that I,2482.119,4.96,2484.599
wondered that I've been waiting for for,2485.28,5.92,2488.2400000000002
a a long time because I'm a,2487.079,8.76,2491.4590000000003
perfectionist nothing of value is gained,2491.2,4.639,2493.5195
easily how,2499.319,5.641,2502.1394999999998
beautiful isn't,2501.64,3.32,2503.2999999999997

world not the Perfection of the,2520.16,5.919,2523.1195
enamoring how,2523.319,5.76,2526.199
lovely I had to wait for it for 7 years,2526.079,4.921,2528.5395000000003
my representative in Paris was a fool he,2529.079,3.801,2530.9795000000004
let himself be out bit by a,2531.0,4.16,2533.08
Frenchman but you was,2532.88,4.68,2535.2200000000003
waited finally in 39 I learned through a,2537.56,6.039,2540.5795
contact at in the French Su that the,2540.64,5.08,2543.18
sister of the owner was seized in,2543.599,4.401,2545.7995
Germany he would take all his money and,2545.72,6.399,2548.9195
more to get the old lady out so I made,2548.0,8.68,2552.34
my bid and we had to accept it was a,2552.119,4.561,2554.3995
bargain I never saw such a,2567.079,5.881,2570.0195000000003
collection all my life I believe that if,2570.599,4.281,2572.7395
you were willing to take the time and,2572.96,3.92,2574.92
energy you could have anything you,2574.88,3.76,2576.76
all my life I sought Perfection it seems,2578.64,7.6,2582.44
perfect now it is,2582.28,3.96,2584.26
perfect pardon the interruption but I,2587.24,5.4,2589.9399999999996
thought the lights were still,2590.0,6.04,2593.02
on Bogle I'm a coward hit me and I'll,2592.64,5.76,2595.52

fingernail how dare you suggest anything,2630.119,3.921,2632.0795000000003
of the sort I don't suppose I could,2632.559,3.921,2634.5195000000003
prove this to a well to a jury but I,2634.04,4.92,2636.5
think Mar would listen and he'd be,2636.48,4.76,2638.86
disappointed in you besides it happens,2638.96,4.159,2641.0395
to be his money money won't do you any,2641.24,4.92,2643.7

and go signals on the street corners,2782.04,3.559,2783.8195
maybe used to playing with traffic cops,2783.96,3.72,2785.82
but bogle's no traffic C,2785.599,3.641,2787.4195
there are no stuff and go signals here,2787.68,3.28,2789.3199999999997
they haven't even put the roads in yet,2789.24,3.44,2790.9599999999996
maybe that's why I thought you were the,2790.96,6.359,2794.1395
Cavalry and not a minute late what I,2792.68,7.2,2796.2799999999997

when did you get that,2835.16,3.08,2836.7
car you wouldn't be,2839.24,5.119,2841.7994999999996
interested what do I have to do to prove,2841.72,3.48,2843.4599999999996
I I want to be,2845.2,6.56,2848.48
friend I'm being honest with,2847.44,4.32,2849.6
you it happened 2 years,2858.359,3.841,2860.2795
ago when I ask myself how long ago that,2862.4,5.0,2864.9
was it adds up to a,2864.96,5.0,2867.46
century I was a desert Hunter and guide,2867.4,5.159,2869.9795
I like being what I was problem was a,2869.96,4.72,2872.32
thing you solv not something,2872.559,4.401,2874.7595
you not something you lived with well,2874.68,5.2,2877.2799999999997
that slowly chokes you to,2876.96,5.92,2879.92
death I taken this fool Ingram 2 days,2879.88,5.28,2882.52
east of the main party lion hunting in,2882.88,4.719,2885.2395
the scrub country we had no luck and,2885.16,4.919,2887.6195
somehow the failure seem more my fault,2887.599,5.401,2890.2995
because I never really liked them,2890.079,6.16,2893.159
man we better turn back in the morning,2897.48,4.76,2899.86
it's pretty close to the prohibited area,2900.88,3.719,2902.7395
and those boys are kind of,2902.24,4.68,2904.58
touchy it wouldn't be bad to do this,2904.599,4.72,2906.9590000000003
come up with a handful of,2906.92,5.639,2909.7395
diamonds or a bullet in your back from,2909.319,5.481,2912.0595
what you tell me a man could slip into,2912.559,5.321,2915.2195
the area and with any luck you to lie,2914.8,4.48,2917.04
down and pinch yourself because you're,2917.88,3.719,2919.7395
asleep but when I awoke I found he'd,2935.839,4.641,2938.1594999999998
already decided to try his,2938.52,4.33,2940.685
luck he taken the better of the two,2940.48,6.119,2943.5395
horses and the hoofprints headed,2946.599,3.291,2948.2445000000002
straight for the prohibited,2948.559,17.201,2957.1595
he was traveling fast for a man who,2971.0,2.76,2972.38
didn't know the desert,2972.4,5.12,2974.96
country too fast for his,2973.76,3.76,2975.6400000000003
horse by this time I knew my own animal,2985.52,3.76,2987.4
wouldn't be good for much,2987.92,3.48,2989.66
longer and I was feeling the heat in the,2989.28,4.6,2991.5800000000004
myself but sometimes an acted begins in,2994.68,5.6,2997.48
stupidity has to go on Mile by mile,2997.319,6.24,3000.439
until it reaches its logical,3000.28,3.279,3001.9195000000004
I finally reached the diamond C the,3047.96,4.2,3050.06
black mountains are which Ingram spoke,3050.0,4.079,3052.0395
constantly there were traces of the,3052.16,4.12,3054.22
bottom of a giant river that flowed a,3054.079,5.081,3056.6195000000002
thousands centuries ago I knew the end,3056.28,5.55,3059.0550000000003
couldn't be far away it,3059.16,4.12,3061.22
wasn't there he lay hugging the Earth as,3063.28,3.99,3065.275
if it would save,3066.0,12.87,3072.435
him and there it was that I first saw,3081.52,5.96,3084.5
them a million to one shot and Ingram,3084.359,6.321,3087.5195
hit the jackpot a bushel of dull Pebbles,3087.48,6.0,3090.48
that didn't even glisten in the Sun but,3090.68,4.52,3092.94
with enough to buy The Souls of a,3093.48,2.96,3094.96
men still I didn't take them don't ask,3096.44,5.44,3099.16
me why there are lots of reasons why a,3099.319,5.681,3102.1594999999998
man won't take what isn't,3101.88,3.12,3103.44
if you asked me how long I,3174.48,6.2,3177.58
walked the answer could be 5 hours or 2,3177.119,7.921,3181.0795000000003
days time was a CLE that had no,3180.68,4.36,3182.8599999999997
end and though the sun smashed into my,3185.2,4.2,3187.2999999999997
brain the message that I'd never be able,3187.76,6.24,3190.88
to make it back still I had to keep,3189.4,4.6,3191.7000000000003
maybe it would have been better if vogle,3232.96,2.48,3234.2
never found,3234.28,3.839,3236.1995
us at least it would have been,3235.44,4.919,3237.8995
simpler one of the things I hate Vogal,3238.119,4.68,3240.4590000000003
for is finding us still,3240.359,5.521,3243.1195
alive they took us back to Diamond St,3242.799,4.8,3245.199
and in the last minutes before he died,3245.88,3.239,3247.4995
Ingram must have babbled of what they,3247.599,3.921,3249.5595000000003
found in his fist but he didn't live,3249.119,4.081,3251.1595
long enough to tell them where he found,3251.52,4.279,3253.6595
it the commant had to know in a hurry,3253.2,4.599,3255.4995
for modale was away and this was his big,3255.799,4.52,3258.059
chance to prove himself a hero so to,3257.799,4.201,3259.8995
soften me up vogle and his men went to,3260.319,3.321,3261.9795
work on me with their fists and their,3262.0,4.0,3264.0
boots while I was still out of my mind,3263.64,3.6,3265.44
and couldn't tell him even though I,3266.0,3.839,3267.9195
would have been willing to that was his,3267.24,3.64,3269.06
mistake well that's,3270.88,4.959,3273.3595
it a beating like that does something to,3273.16,4.88,3275.6
you when I came around I wouldn't have,3275.839,4.76,3278.219
told them my name didn't feel any,3278.04,3.759,3279.9195
different then I don't feel any,3280.599,5.641,3283.4195
different now except now you want the,3281.799,7.441,3285.5195
diamonds let's say I want the diamonds,3286.24,6.16,3289.3199999999997

could never get away with it please,3292.4,4.719,3294.7595

to you I am staying how long do you,3297.119,4.96,3299.599
think Mel will hold Fu back until he's,3299.72,3.76,3301.6
sure there's no chance of my leading him,3302.079,4.361,3304.2595
to the diamonds exactly please listen to,3303.48,7.24,3307.1
me it's over now you are still alive be,3306.44,6.04,3309.46
satisfied that's not enough just to be,3310.72,4.44,3312.9399999999996
alive doing sleeping to move when they,3312.48,3.879,3314.4195
beat me for something I didn't do it,3315.16,3.199,3316.7594999999997
hurting the away blows never did before,3316.359,3.401,3318.0595
the pain won't leave until I get what I,3318.359,3.72,3320.219
already paid for when will you learn,3319.76,4.52,3322.0200000000004
that you cannot get along that way you,3322.079,4.72,3324.4390000000003

not the only one who has been hurt by,3329.319,3.841,3331.2395
life of course I'm not but you've got to,3331.079,3.841,3332.9995000000004
fight back for a,3333.16,4.399,3335.3595
time and then you realize it does no,3334.92,6.32,3338.08
good so you shrug your shoulders and say,3337.559,6.401,3340.7595
that's the way of the world I shall live,3341.24,5.76,3344.12
that way I'd rather be dead you will be,3343.96,4.28,3346.1

underestimating your patient's powers of,5246.76,4.959,5249.239500000001

apparently it sometimes,5270.96,6.239,5274.0795
happens the patient was a man of,5273.239,8.161,5277.3195
considerable more than normal strength Y,5277.199,8.241,5281.3195

you about about this guide well there's,5412.32,5.919,5415.2795
another chapter to it now I think it,5415.08,6.24,5418.2
would interest you I thought it would he,5418.239,5.561,5421.019499999999
made it he made it into the prohibited,5421.32,4.96,5423.799999999999
area and out again with the diamonds,5423.8,5.68,5426.64
glorious Dash glorious and now now he,5426.28,4.32,5428.44
vanished into,5430.6,4.599,5432.8995
thiner who knows perhaps he's here in,5432.56,5.159,5435.1395
Angola and in fact certain information I,5435.199,5.641,5438.019499999999
have leads me to believe he is cu he,5437.719,5.52,5440.479
still faces certain obstacles,5440.84,5.2,5443.4400000000005
like like finding an unscrupulous person,5443.239,5.321,5445.8994999999995
to polish the diamonds and and disposing,5446.04,4.88,5448.48
of him but in all these things if I can,5448.56,4.92,5451.02
only locate the man I could help him I I,5450.92,4.0,5452.92
could even help help him to arrange for,5453.48,3.92,5455.44
a shipment of the diamonds in in small,5454.92,5.16,5457.5
lots to various countries which is what,5457.4,6.56,5460.679999999999
I would suggest oh,5460.08,3.88,5462.0199999999995

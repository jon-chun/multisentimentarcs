do they say how big he is,124.32,4.28,126.46
respectful silence is the least,130.399,4.361,132.5795
would you say the dead man made a,145.04,3.68,146.88
reluctant corpse,146.4,4.32,148.56
a loose tongue soon loses his mouth,148.72,4.159,150.7995
captain orsini,150.72,3.84,152.64
a wise tongue never needs to repeat,152.879,3.201,154.4795
itself tonight as demand nor does a,154.56,5.0,157.06
competent assassin,156.08,3.48,157.82000000000002
duke assad,179.44,3.24,181.06
we have suffered a most tragic loss,199.12,4.8,201.52
my dear sister lucrecia has broken his,202.0,2.959,203.4795
the court will observe a proper period,204.959,4.321,207.11950000000002
of mourning,206.879,5.761,209.7595
how long to locker one year my lordship,209.28,5.2,211.88
the dead must not place too great a,214.48,3.92,216.44
burden on the living it's my belief that,216.319,5.92,219.279
everything even death can be turned into,218.4,3.839,220.3195
profit our army's whole peso remini,224.84,4.28,226.98
we're on the road to orbino bologna,229.12,6.08,232.16
sienna all tuscany the center of italy,232.799,4.16,234.87900000000002
from coast to coast will be ours then,235.2,5.72,238.06
inevitably milan,236.959,3.961,238.9395
and venice,241.12,4.88,243.56
but this devil begotten ferality,243.12,5.199,245.7195
stands blocking our progress,246.0,4.4,248.2
you guarina you're the military genius,248.319,4.081,250.3595
how would you take it perhaps with ten,250.4,4.08,252.44
thousand troops,252.4,4.72,254.76000000000002
or a woman,254.48,2.64,255.79999999999998
we will walk into ferrara through a,259.68,4.32,261.84000000000003
by arranging a marriage between my,264.0,4.4,266.2
recently willed sister to crazier and uh,265.919,5.041,268.4395
alfonso the servant of the duke your,268.4,4.079,270.43949999999995
knows that your destiny is negotiating,272.479,3.761,274.35949999999997
such a marriage with the french king,274.24,4.32,276.40000000000003
alfonso's blacksmith he needs a lusty,276.24,3.84,278.16
woman not one of those,278.56,4.88,281.0
frail french birds and who will convey,280.08,5.6,282.88
this delicate information,283.44,4.479,285.6795
who but a man is quick that deceit is a,292.72,5.12,295.28000000000003
he must have the grace of a dancer the,298.0,3.759,299.8795
wrist of an assassin,299.759,3.521,301.5195
he must have little regard for good,301.759,2.88,303.199
yet by his astuteness be able to confuse,304.639,4.56,306.919
men's minds,307.44,3.52,309.2
must have confidence in himself yet not,309.199,4.081,311.2395
permit that confidence to render him in,310.96,4.239,313.0795
he must charm as a snake charms a bird,315.199,6.641,318.5195
yet he must make no friends,318.96,4.48,321.2
except those that can be of use to him,321.84,3.28,323.47999999999996
and for the same reason although we make,323.44,3.759,325.3195
use of love,325.12,5.12,327.68
he must not love,327.199,3.041,328.71950000000004
he may go now all of you,336.88,4.72,339.24

don esteban was,374.96,4.079,376.99949999999995
annoyed on esteban is easily annoying,376.8,4.56,379.08

be quick enough,390.08,5.76,392.96
you've learned something else today,392.24,3.6,394.04
why your sister's husband was sent to,395.919,4.241,398.0395
another world,397.52,2.64,398.84
one life is little enough to pay for all,401.52,6.16,404.59999999999997
ferrara so long as it's not mine,403.759,6.081,406.7995

with but the great,432.56,5.28,435.2

your lordship will find me a most,454.479,4.641,456.79949999999997
efficient cupid,456.0,3.12,457.56

if i'm ambitious it's only to make,529.92,3.44,531.64
myself worthy of your love,531.36,6.039,534.3795
for without your love i'm nothing,533.36,4.039,535.3795

it's not signed,618.88,2.959,620.3595
would you paint it would be any better,620.16,3.679,621.9995
if it was signed leonardo da vinci which,621.839,4.321,623.9995

what do you think of this,634.24,2.96,635.72

cesare borja pay for that he does in,663.839,3.361,665.5195000000001
opportunities,666.0,3.279,667.6395
how i die is his problem how i live is,667.2,4.72,669.5600000000001
my own uh 60. i'm a poor man on an,669.279,5.12,671.8389999999999
expensive mission 75 and that's my life,671.92,4.32,674.0799999999999

out of love for you 90.,676.24,4.56,678.52
it's worth more than that to me i'll buy,678.959,2.731,680.3245
your painting,680.8,4.749,683.1745
what a moment,685.68,2.48,686.92
did you like,687.04,3.12,688.5999999999999
did you see your eardrums like an angel,688.16,4.32,690.3199999999999
from heaven to find you bargaining like,690.16,5.919,693.1195
a fish not for myself but for the client,692.48,6.56,695.76
oh then it's worth the price no doubt if,696.079,6.681,699.4195
beauty has a price,699.04,3.72,700.9
will you let me have this for a hundred,706.079,3.121,707.6395

i was just thinking with envy and,742.399,4.161,744.4795
admiration of your husband,743.76,4.96,746.24
i was also deploring the fact that,746.56,3.76,748.4399999999999

ferrara the master of the man who was,1065.919,3.841,1067.8395

what's the bed we leave in the early,1085.76,4.919,1088.2195
morning for ferrara,1087.28,3.399,1088.9795
there's a fine in at crispino,1107.44,4.4,1109.64
with a beautiful kitchen,1109.6,4.319,1111.7595
would your logic wish to spend the night,1111.84,3.28,1113.48
that's a prosperous looking farm,1115.12,3.52,1116.8799999999999
why shouldn't it be,1118.64,3.76,1120.5200000000002
that's the widow zappos,1120.16,4.399,1122.3595
why do you turn down your nose at it ah,1122.4,5.6,1125.2
to answer that would be really a story,1124.559,5.521,1127.3195
there was the father,1128.0,3.679,1129.8395
a blacksmith,1130.08,4.56,1132.36
and his good wife mona maria,1131.679,6.24,1134.799
they had a son who was more than bright,1134.64,6.159,1137.7195000000002
so the poor foolish parents saved their,1137.919,4.64,1140.239
money to send him to pardon to study,1140.799,4.0,1142.799

are even now within striking distance of,1577.76,4.08,1579.8
your peaceful duchy this is hardly the,1579.679,4.961,1582.1595
time for one to murder his emissary,1581.84,4.319,1583.9995
even if he had thought it necessary to,1584.64,2.96,1586.1200000000001
send one for other than the most,1586.159,3.601,1587.9595000000002
affectionate of reason,1587.6,4.64,1589.9199999999998

commands i beg a moment the lord,1614.559,4.081,1616.5995
i have long looked forward to this,1617.279,3.441,1618.9995
as a soldier to bow before your,1621.919,3.201,1623.5195
lordship's genius,1623.36,4.24,1625.4799999999998
your grace is a man of fame,1625.12,3.919,1627.0794999999998
the whole world waits with anxious,1627.6,3.92,1629.56
wonder for your next invention,1629.039,4.801,1631.4395
from highest castle to humblest hut the,1631.52,4.56,1633.8
question is ever the same,1633.84,4.079,1635.8795
what new type of cannon will the genius,1636.08,5.12,1638.6399999999999
alfonzo deste next devise,1637.919,4.321,1640.0795
because upon canon defends the future of,1642.24,3.6,1644.04
and upon war,1645.84,4.64,1648.1599999999999
depends the future of history,1647.279,5.921,1650.2395
who then can deny that history may well,1650.48,4.88,1652.92
nominate alfonso desti,1653.2,5.92,1656.16
as the greatest man of his age,1655.36,3.76,1657.24
you're a man of intelligence,1661.279,4.081,1663.3195
i'll show you something that'll make,1664.08,3.28,1665.72
your blood run cold,1665.36,3.52,1667.12
i'll show you something that'll make,1667.36,3.23,1668.975
yours run hot,1668.88,5.3,1671.5300000000002
who builds this first may well open the,1679.679,2.801,1681.0795
each of those tubes are gone,1682.48,4.4,1684.68
in each gun a shot,1684.799,3.681,1686.6395
all to be sent against the enemy in,1686.88,3.2,1688.48
rapid fire,1688.48,5.679,1691.3195
it is absolutely irresistible,1690.08,6.319,1693.2395
one hundred thousand ducats and that's,1694.159,4.561,1696.4395000000002
not all there's steel as well as gold in,1696.399,5.201,1698.9995
this dowry the lances of duke chaser,1698.72,4.4,1700.92
enough to protect the rights of ferrara,1701.6,3.679,1703.4395
against any state,1703.12,4.88,1705.56
but the supreme dowry is herself,1705.279,4.561,1707.5595
her beauty and the love she bears your,1708.0,2.96,1709.48
excellence,1709.84,2.4,1711.04
she's only seen me once then she was,1712.24,2.88,1713.68
little more than an infant childhood,1713.6,3.12,1715.1599999999999
impressions are the most lasting,1715.12,3.36,1716.8
especially when they are fed to maturity,1716.72,4.48,1718.96
by constant curiosity,1718.48,7.079,1722.0195
you are her first and only love,1721.2,4.359,1723.3795
i risk my life when i tell you this,1727.44,4.08,1729.48
but it was she who said to me one day,1729.84,3.12,1731.3999999999999
and i quote,1731.52,3.6,1733.32
it might very well be that alfonzo desti,1732.96,4.4,1735.16
with his brilliant mind,1735.12,4.32,1737.28
fits the role of italy's supreme ruler,1737.36,5.6,1740.1599999999999
better than my brother chasery,1739.44,4.959,1741.9195
one stroke of the pen my lord and you,1742.96,3.28,1744.6000000000001
have brought glory to ferrara and joy to,1744.399,4.241,1746.5194999999999
two hundred thousand,1748.64,4.8,1751.0400000000002
amend the document and sign the lord,1750.88,4.799,1753.2795
and i wager that your noble father is as,1753.44,4.959,1755.9195
unable to resist that heroic figure,1755.679,4.48,1757.919
as the beautiful lucrative is unable to,1758.399,5.081,1760.9395
resist yours,1760.159,3.321,1761.8195
i'm very very pleased with myself andrea,1777.12,6.08,1780.1599999999999
i'm a man of extraordinary fine,1781.039,5.76,1783.919
judgments so i tell you how i know this,1783.2,6.719,1786.5595
because i chose you to go to ferrara and,1786.799,4.801,1789.1995
you did well,1789.919,4.161,1791.9995000000001
remarkably well,1791.6,6.76,1794.98
i congratulate myself,1794.08,4.28,1796.22
this new problem,1811.039,4.481,1813.2795
will be more profitable for you,1813.12,4.72,1815.4799999999998
and more amusing,1815.52,4.96,1818.0
what you win is yours subjects to my,1817.84,4.64,1820.1599999999999
control of course,1820.48,3.76,1822.3600000000001
and it includes,1822.48,5.4,1825.18
a rare jewel,1824.24,3.64,1826.06
my garden is filled with beautiful women,1839.679,4.321,1841.8395
and you stand here like a brooding,1841.84,5.199,1844.4395
nemesis i was thinking good practice,1844.0,4.559,1846.2795
makes perfect,1847.039,2.721,1848.3995
i should listen now you might learn,1848.559,4.401,1850.7595
something come along,1849.76,3.2,1851.36
the obvious is always a deceitful,1853.12,3.2,1854.7199999999998
temptation in the world of practical,1854.799,3.041,1856.3195
affairs for example,1856.32,3.28,1857.96
the obvious solution to the problems i'm,1857.84,3.28,1859.48
about to present to you might be an,1859.6,3.76,1861.48
assassin's blade,1861.12,4.559,1863.3995
in the back of that,1863.36,4.159,1865.4395
gentle old man,1865.679,3.6,1867.479
as a matter of fact your good friend don,1867.519,4.721,1869.8795
esteban has already suggested it,1869.279,5.841,1872.1995
and i question its wisdom it has value,1872.24,4.64,1874.56
except that it's,1875.12,4.72,1877.4799999999998
now there is the jewel,1881.519,6.321,1884.6795
imagine all that beauty wasted on a,1887.84,6.0,1890.84
husband old enough to be a grandfather,1890.159,3.681,1891.9995000000001
spring in the lap of winter,1896.159,6.081,1899.1995000000002
which you're the man to correct that,1899.279,4.0,1901.279
we'll have to climb high to get to her,1903.279,5.12,1905.839
the duchy is an eagle's nest sitting,1906.0,5.039,1908.5195
atop a mountain,1908.399,3.841,1910.3194999999998
is there anything about what you're,1911.039,2.321,1912.1995
running for,1912.24,3.439,1913.9595
your plans for cheetah del monte very,1913.36,3.52,1915.12
i want it by next spring,1916.88,3.519,1918.6395
you launch your plans to invade the,1919.12,3.439,1920.8394999999998
marches in the summer you see captain,1920.399,4.321,1922.5594999999998
what a quick mind he has now where do we,1922.559,4.96,1925.039
start our conquest of chitta del monte,1924.72,4.0,1926.72
the husband,1927.519,5.64,1930.339
an old wall is more easily breached,1928.72,4.439,1930.9395
host has designated the noble,1952.0,3.44,1953.72
messerocini to be our guided mentor,1953.44,3.68,1955.28
while we're in rome,1955.44,3.76,1957.3200000000002
from what i know of the noble metro,1957.12,2.96,1958.6
there should be no one more competent to,1960.08,4.0,1962.08
guard us from evil than hate you've met,1961.84,4.559,1964.1195
before maloma,1964.08,4.88,1966.52
have we miss your sin,1966.399,4.64,1968.7189999999998
an unfair question madonna,1968.96,4.079,1970.9995000000001
i could play the gallant and answer,1971.039,3.681,1972.8795
yes a thousand times each time i've,1973.039,3.921,1974.9995
looked on beauty or i could be cautious,1974.72,4.079,1976.7595000000001
and sly and say that,1976.96,3.839,1978.8795
madonna's memory will guide my answer,1978.799,4.961,1981.2794999999999
you would not be easy to forget,1980.799,4.321,1982.9595
a man's ego demands that he be,1983.76,3.6,1985.56
completely remembered if ever met,1985.12,3.84,1987.04
therefore in self-defense i must assume,1987.36,3.12,1988.9199999999998
madonna means that,1988.96,2.7,1990.31
we have never met,1990.48,2.72,1991.84
there you have a perfect illustration of,1993.2,4.079,1995.2395000000001
the language of diplomacy somebody asked,1995.2,3.839,1997.1195
me now these two have never met and i,1997.279,4.321,1999.4395
assure you i couldn't answer yes or no,1999.039,4.721,2001.3995
does it really matter my lord of course,2001.6,4.4,2003.8
not making this all seen his pardon one,2003.76,3.919,2005.7195
meets and forgets thousands of people in,2006.0,3.519,2007.7595
the course of a lifetime,2007.679,4.48,2009.919
it is my pleasure as well as my duty,2009.519,4.321,2011.6795
to make our association in rome a,2012.159,4.4,2014.3590000000002
memorable one,2013.84,2.719,2015.1995
we came to rome for our soul's sake and,2017.6,3.919,2019.5594999999998
in god's keeping and we ask for no,2019.84,3.76,2021.72
better protection nevertheless it is,2021.519,3.681,2023.3595
gratifying to know that we have your,2023.6,3.919,2025.5594999999998
excellencies protection as well if only,2025.2,3.92,2027.16
against those who think themselves,2027.519,3.52,2029.279
beyond god's will but there's been no,2029.12,3.76,2031.0
link between us to create friendship and,2031.039,3.681,2032.8795
trust we must correct that we must,2032.88,3.679,2034.7195000000002
exchange ambassadors,2034.72,4.24,2036.84
well it's the only solution,2036.559,4.0,2038.559
i will appoint an ambassador before your,2038.96,3.599,2040.7595000000001
lordship leaves rome,2040.559,4.801,2042.9595
as a matter of fact i point him now,2042.559,5.441,2045.2794999999999
mr andrea orsini,2045.36,6.719,2048.7194999999997
one of the most amiable former young men,2048.0,4.079,2050.0395
we shall welcome you to our court as a,2053.359,4.0,2055.359
friend messer,2055.44,4.56,2057.7200000000003
i am dedicated to your senior service,2057.359,5.601,2060.1594999999998
from this moment on,2060.0,2.96,2061.48
the journey has been fatiguing,2063.28,4.0,2065.28
may we have your lordships permission to,2065.679,4.601,2067.9795
the problem suits you uniquely,2074.8,4.48,2077.04
it will not be easy,2077.44,3.36,2079.12
i will deliver to your magnificence,2079.28,3.52,2081.0400000000004
cheetah del monte and the loyalty of its,2080.8,4.799,2083.1995
people by spring to be taken by romantic,2082.8,6.24,2085.92
conquest we borders are not,2085.599,3.441,2087.3195
somewhere in between we'll worry about,2094.48,3.84,2096.4
her when the time comes,2096.56,3.519,2098.3195
you promised we would be married on his,2098.32,3.84,2100.2400000000002
return from marriage is a formality,2100.079,3.52,2101.8390000000004
which can be accomplished at any time,2102.16,4.56,2104.44
problems of state come first,2103.599,4.881,2106.0395000000003
is this agreeable to you,2106.72,5.96,2109.7
my lord demands i obey,2108.48,4.2,2110.58
our reason were there once you've made,2116.16,3.919,2118.1195
the old man's wife love you not not to,2118.079,3.76,2119.9590000000003
be too difficult for your aunts and,2120.079,3.601,2121.8795
barely to make a widow of her i'm told,2121.839,4.721,2124.1994999999997
he's quite a subtle rascal,2123.68,4.48,2125.9199999999996
excellent women are the gauge of a man's,2128.16,4.11,2130.2149999999997
you are an artist barely you have the,2135.28,4.64,2137.6000000000004
touch of the courtier the breeding of a,2137.359,4.081,2139.3995
gentleman you're born for great,2139.92,3.76,2141.8
enterprise white sits,2141.44,3.52,2143.2000000000003
you overrate me a thousand-fold no could,2145.76,5.52,2148.5200000000004
you have allied yourself with a more,2148.88,4.959,2151.3595
promising patron than,2151.28,4.799,2153.6795
captain orcini's,2153.839,4.0,2155.839
brilliant young man with the flesh is,2156.079,3.841,2157.9995000000004
perverted very weak versus,2157.839,3.201,2159.4395
it's always well to take precautions,2161.04,4.559,2163.3195
thus if the noble or seen he remains,2163.68,3.679,2165.5195
faithful to my service he will continue,2165.599,5.441,2168.3195
to serve me by serving him but,2167.359,7.681,2171.1994999999997
if god forbid he should,2171.04,4.0,2173.04
for any reason,2177.92,2.8,2179.32
he will continue to serve me there you,2184.0,5.92,2186.96
are 200 yucats,2186.72,3.2,2188.3199999999997
your graciousness has made me wealthy,2191.839,4.161,2193.9195
beyond my most impossible dream,2193.76,4.56,2196.0400000000004
have no illusions about my generosity,2196.0,5.44,2198.72
knowledge is always a good investment,2198.32,7.68,2202.1600000000003
i also know when i've made a bad bargain,2201.44,4.56,2203.7200000000003
good night,2208.4,29.72,2223.26
i would like to say a few words,2275.2,3.68,2277.04
captain orcini comes to us as cesare,2278.96,6.399,2282.1595
borges ambassador that is good,2282.32,5.279,2284.9595000000004
perhaps the duke will learn through his,2285.359,5.361,2288.0395
ambassador that if we prosper it is,2287.599,5.441,2290.3195
because we live in peace,2290.72,4.72,2293.08
and that if we enjoy peace,2293.04,4.96,2295.52
it is because we want only friendship,2295.44,5.36,2298.12
and understanding of our neighbors and,2298.0,4.64,2300.32
of each other,2300.8,3.76,2302.6800000000003
i depend on you all,2302.64,4.88,2305.08
to help captain orsini to send this,2304.56,5.92,2307.52
message to his illustrious master,2307.52,4.46,2309.75

but i know also that i,2330.0,4.56,2332.28
i was not sent here for that,2332.0,4.32,2334.16

chasery has already told me that your,2336.32,3.6,2338.1200000000003
defenses are,2338.48,3.28,2340.12
impregnable,2339.92,4.32,2342.08
he has also told me that one citizen of,2341.76,5.04,2344.28
chita del monte is worth five hundred,2344.24,3.79,2346.1349999999998
mercenaries,2346.8,5.039,2349.3195
in his wisdom you chaser has identified,2351.839,4.0,2353.839
your strength,2354.24,3.839,2356.1594999999998
as loyalty,2355.839,4.161,2357.9195
i am here to spy,2358.079,3.921,2360.0395000000003
on that loyalty,2360.0,3.52,2361.76
to learn for him the secret of how it,2362.0,3.04,2363.52
i am already learning,2365.04,4.14,2367.11
please help me to learn more,2367.04,9.01,2371.545
we must talk alone baby beatrice will,2379.92,4.54,2382.19
fetch you later,2382.0,12.559,2388.2795
madonna camille is in the chat,2406.079,7.881,2410.0195000000003
will you please wait here yes thank you,2408.24,5.72,2411.1
i know that borges sent you here for,2453.68,3.84,2455.6
some evil purpose,2455.28,4.72,2457.6400000000003
i've asked you here to give you warning,2457.52,5.44,2460.24
my husband is your husband again,2460.0,4.8,2462.4
if any harm should come to my husband,2462.96,4.32,2465.12
through you i will hate you unto the,2464.8,3.84,2466.7200000000003
i promise you i know how to hate,2468.64,5.52,2471.4
or love the twin of hate,2471.599,5.281,2474.2395

there will be peace between us so long,2476.88,4.959,2479.3595
as you act peaceably,2478.64,3.199,2480.2394999999997
so you found our chapel,2498.0,3.44,2499.72
lovely isn't it,2500.0,3.52,2501.76
i come here every night,2501.44,6.52,2504.7000000000003
it makes my sleep more peaceful,2503.52,4.44,2505.74
sometimes i end by wishing that old age,2510.64,4.959,2513.1195
was slurring coming,2512.96,4.8,2515.36
if old age brings wisdom such as yours,2515.599,7.161,2519.1795
my lord it comes too slowly to suit me,2517.76,5.0,2520.26
you find my wife attractive don't you,2525.359,5.121,2527.9195
only with the deepest respects in your,2528.4,3.52,2530.1600000000003
i regretted your lordship thinks ill of,2531.92,2.48,2533.16
i think he'll have no one your lordship,2534.4,3.52,2536.1600000000003
is tolerant,2536.88,2.64,2538.2000000000003
i am tolerant of nothing that might,2537.92,3.84,2539.84
affect madonna's honor,2539.52,4.48,2541.7599999999998
but the certainty i have of her excludes,2541.76,4.96,2544.2400000000002
jealousy suspicion and such cleptrep,2544.0,4.64,2546.32
mind you she's abolioni,2546.72,3.84,2548.64
her blood's hot enough she's as capable,2548.64,3.36,2550.3199999999997
of going to the devil as any other of,2550.56,2.64,2551.88
but i'm certain of this if she does go,2553.2,5.04,2555.72
she won't sneak about it she'll tell me,2555.92,3.6,2557.7200000000003
that's my certainty and my pride,2559.52,5.76,2562.4
i don't think i love you,2565.28,5.039,2567.7995
i've lived 70 years,2568.24,4.8,2570.64
and i know that in spite of the poets,2570.319,6.721,2573.6794999999997
youth is not their happiest season,2573.04,4.0,2575.04
i'll not detain you longer incidentally,2577.119,5.801,2580.0195000000003
i returned this,2579.359,3.561,2581.1394999999998
i can hardly wait for spring to see what,2623.839,4.24,2625.959
they look like each year we tolerate,2625.599,3.52,2627.3590000000004
because it brings us the new flowers of,2629.119,5.0,2631.619
will you excuse me my damn,2641.44,4.04,2643.46
give me a thousand men and enough food,2648.4,4.0,2650.4
and ammunition i could hold this place,2650.24,3.839,2652.1594999999998
until the enemy either starved to death,2652.4,2.48,2653.64
died of old age but the way it's left,2654.88,5.199,2657.4795
unguarded now,2657.44,5.23,2660.055
good morning my lord good morning,2660.079,5.201,2662.6795
of all chica del monte this is my,2665.28,3.6,2667.0800000000004
favorite place,2667.44,3.679,2669.2795
whenever i'm troubled whenever i need to,2668.88,4.64,2671.2000000000003
work out a difficult problem i come here,2671.119,5.521,2673.8795
and always i find the solution,2673.52,4.4,2675.72
it's frightening,2676.64,4.32,2678.7999999999997
a loose pebble a gust of wind and,2677.92,5.919,2680.8795
are you afraid of death,2680.96,4.24,2683.08
i can't say that i have any great,2683.839,3.76,2685.719
affection for it,2685.2,6.44,2688.4199999999996
look below you my friend,2687.599,4.041,2689.6195000000002
for 70 years i've watched the seasons,2692.8,3.68,2694.6400000000003
i've seen the vibrant life of summer,2696.48,4.879,2698.9195
the brilliant death of fall,2699.2,4.48,2701.4399999999996
the silent grave of winter,2701.359,4.72,2703.719
and then i've seen the resurrection of,2703.68,5.439,2706.3995
spring the glorious birth of new life,2706.079,5.201,2708.6795
and my father and my father's father,2709.119,4.96,2711.599
have seen him before me,2711.28,6.24,2714.4
nothing ever dies my friend,2714.079,5.52,2716.8390000000004
you don't believe that do you,2717.52,4.48,2719.7599999999998
i don't have your wisdom lord,2719.599,3.921,2721.5595000000003
i believe that i was born and that i,2722.0,3.68,2723.84
must die and that i must make the best,2723.52,4.64,2725.84
of what lies between the two extremes,2725.68,4.0,2727.68
the gardeners have finished and are,2729.68,3.12,2731.24
waiting for further instructions,2730.96,3.84,2732.88
no need for you to run uphill to do me,2732.8,4.24,2734.92
there we have much time before winter,2734.8,4.48,2737.04
sets in won't you come along now excuse,2737.04,5.24,2739.66
perfect absolutely heavens,2746.079,4.961,2748.5595000000003
whenever we wish we give the old man a,2748.96,7.24,2752.58
problem to think out he comes up here,2751.04,5.16,2753.62
i thought a court here in cavalier left,2793.839,5.28,2796.479
dubbing with paint as a craftsman,2795.68,5.84,2798.6
your husband finds pleasure in work one,2799.119,4.321,2801.2795
usually leaves for gardeners,2801.52,3.52,2803.28
his roses are the most beautiful in,2803.44,3.84,2805.36
it's not for me to say the same for my,2807.28,3.839,2809.1995
you have a certain skill,2812.079,3.961,2814.0595000000003
i try madonna i try one can do no more,2819.2,4.8,2821.6
you've missed none of the evil in his,2824.4,3.04,2825.92
judas iscariot was evil,2827.44,4.12,2829.5
i imagine you find painting beauty more,2832.72,2.81,2834.125
i paint what i see and feel madonna,2837.119,4.24,2839.239
if one is beautiful inside as well as,2839.52,2.88,2840.96
my brush can neither take from nor add,2842.4,4.719,2844.7595
to that beauty,2844.4,2.719,2845.7595
actually it's quite good,2848.48,5.599,2851.2795
are you as good with women,2851.76,5.92,2854.7200000000003
i've been very successful with women,2854.079,6.24,2857.199
when you finish this,2863.52,3.039,2865.0395
perhaps you will do some of my ladies,2867.92,6.56,2871.2000000000003
that is if you have nothing else to do,2870.96,3.52,2872.7200000000003
perhaps madonna herself,2875.119,3.521,2876.8795

1933 it's been a long time since I first,82.04,4.66,84.37
looked out into this Valley in southern,85.2,5.459,87.9295
Utah and said to myself Tom Acres this,86.7,6.059,89.7295
is sure pretty country,90.659,4.021,92.6695
how'd you like to live here have your,92.759,3.781,94.6495
own place where there's plenty of gold,94.68,4.32,96.84

I said we were going to church,1545.779,4.02,1547.789
this is it,1549.799,3.0,1551.299
and Neighbors,1552.799,2.841,1554.2195
the Bible says,1555.799,5.521,1558.5595
six days shall thou work,1557.96,5.699,1560.8095
and on the seventh,1561.32,5.459,1564.0494999999999
Thou shalt rest,1563.659,5.4,1566.3590000000002
the Lord knows we need the rest,1569.059,5.521,1571.8195
but being the almighty he,1574.58,6.36,1577.76
well he he also knows that we need,1577.76,5.64,1580.58
our water piped down to our cattle and,1580.94,4.32,1583.1000000000001
or there won't be nothing left,1585.26,4.74,1587.6299999999999
likewise knowing that every minute,1588.2,3.479,1589.9395
well he won't mind if we make this,1591.679,5.161,1594.2595000000001
meeting short,1594.38,5.7,1597.23
so we'll just start out by offering up,1596.84,5.78,1599.73
I'm not much good at this as you can,1616.22,5.6,1619.02
tell by listening to me but,1618.08,3.74,1619.9499999999998
we're here to ask you to bless us,1622.279,6.0,1625.279
especially Tom Eggers for letting us,1625.76,4.019,1627.7694999999999
have the use of the water which is on,1628.279,3.0,1629.779
his property,1629.779,4.321,1631.9395
I know we haven't always been friendly,1631.279,4.14,1633.349
or neighborly enough,1635.419,3.26,1637.0490000000002
there's often a dry spell in their,1639.14,4.32,1641.3000000000002
like in the land but,1643.46,5.339,1646.1295
if each of us is,1646.64,5.1,1649.19
willing to forgive our enemy,1648.799,4.74,1651.1689999999999
then maybe,1651.74,5.84,1654.66
you'll see fit to end this drought,1653.539,4.041,1655.5595

look Tom what's the use of cheating,3116.76,3.839,3118.6795
you can't build up a business out of,3120.599,4.441,3122.8195
hopes and dreams,3122.46,5.159,3125.0395
we've been talking to Gil,3125.04,5.7,3127.89
you know Matt,3127.619,4.74,3129.989
that Matt's crazy,3130.74,2.819,3132.1495
if they've got a synthetic tanning,3133.559,3.901,3135.5095
nobody's going to need that bark of,3135.66,3.659,3137.4894999999997
yours he thinks I lied to you about,3137.46,4.74,3139.83
those orders no it's just that,3139.319,4.681,3141.6594999999998
maybe the Tanner sent those orders,3142.2,4.8,3144.6
before they'd seen this chemical uh-huh,3144.0,5.16,3146.58
take a look at them,3147.0,3.599,3148.7995
there's one in there it's only three,3149.16,3.659,3150.9894999999997
months old,3150.599,4.141,3152.6695
I don't get it,3152.819,4.8,3155.219
isn't the synthetic tanning any good,3154.74,6.0,3157.74
well it's all right for some Heights but,3157.619,5.7,3160.469
not for the real fine skins,3160.74,5.64,3163.56
I knew it soon as I saw the skins,3163.319,5.701,3166.1695
that's why I've been trying to hang on,3166.38,5.4,3169.08
well then what's holding it back I'm,3169.02,4.319,3171.1795
I can't hire anybody,3173.339,4.801,3175.7395
I thought maybe if you and I could work,3175.92,3.36,3177.6
we could get out enough bark the fill,3179.28,3.18,3180.8700000000003
those orders,3180.9,4.02,3182.9100000000003
do you think we could sure,3182.46,4.379,3184.6495
be a little tough till the depression,3184.92,4.02,3186.9300000000003

if you're going to live out here you'll,3541.319,2.821,3542.7295
have to get over that notion or you,3542.7,4.46,3544.93

I don't like killing any better than you,3547.319,2.941,3548.7895
and I've never done it unless it was,3550.26,3.24,3551.88
some varmint like a rattlesnake or a,3551.76,3.299,3553.4095
or something I needed to eat,3555.059,5.04,3557.579
you know some of us didn't cut down on,3556.92,5.82,3559.83
the deer and the cats that overrun the,3560.099,4.26,3562.2290000000003
country so bad you couldn't raise a,3562.74,4.92,3565.2
stalk a corner a single head of cattle,3564.359,5.22,3566.969
funny thing but the,3567.66,3.959,3569.6394999999998
balance in nature gets unbalanced,3569.579,3.661,3571.4095
I suppose maybe it's man's fault,3573.24,5.579,3576.0294999999996

here's a position and well thought of in,514.8,3.599,516.5994999999999
these parts there must be some mistake I,516.839,2.76,518.219
wish it were a mistake where too many,518.399,2.58,519.689
people recognize his blue and silver,519.599,3.421,521.3095000000001
uniform Captain Evans himself showed me,520.979,3.48,522.719

which this place is made on Ramon,533.16,5.58,535.9499999999999
this whole thing has come as somewhat of,536.82,4.38,539.0100000000001
a shock but Spain is our Ally and I have,538.74,4.92,541.2
a duty to my king if there is one shred,541.2,4.44,543.4200000000001

see you and to see Peter in prison why,681.18,4.02,683.1899999999999
have you refused me necessity has tied,683.16,4.28,685.3
the need to silence,688.14,2.66,689.47
policy is a fact that your fiance seems,694.86,3.84,696.78
to have forgotten,697.56,2.82,698.9699999999999
who could prove such an absurd,698.7,3.78,700.59
accusation the proof will be thoroughly,700.38,3.48,702.12
examined by the English Court where,702.48,3.24,704.1
blood will stand trial,703.86,3.96,705.84
he was tried once before by an English,705.72,4.52,707.98
to Peter blood had The Misfortune of,717.48,4.799,719.8795
putting healing above all else while,719.459,4.56,721.7389999999999
helping the wounded he was accused of,722.279,4.201,724.3795
disloyalty to the crown,724.019,4.44,726.239
an outrageous government sentenced him,726.48,4.5,728.73
to slavery in the West Indies,728.459,4.5,730.709
forced to work as a slave along with,730.98,3.66,732.8100000000001
those unfortunates he helped as a,732.959,4.381,735.1495
surgeon in the Rebellion,734.64,5.909,737.5945
never was fighting so bitter as between,742.339,5.261,744.9695
those that were in prison and the guards,745.079,4.44,747.299
so misguided that only the urge to kill,747.6,5.16,750.1800000000001
their less fortunate fellows remained so,749.519,6.361,752.6995000000001
they fought as only slaves can fight for,752.76,4.8,755.16
their freedom,755.88,3.26,757.51
and at last,757.56,5.279,760.1995
the prison Gates were opened a score of,759.14,5.98,762.13
hunted men on a tiny Island kept her,762.839,5.661,765.6695000000001
meant death there was a ship in the hub,765.12,5.88,768.0600000000001
a slave ship,768.5,4.54,770.77
faint from hunger and thirst but,771.0,4.44,773.22
fighting desperately for their lives,773.04,5.66,775.87
they took their one last chance,775.44,6.3,778.59
cautiously silently,778.7,6.04,781.72
found meant death they climbed aboard,781.74,6.3,784.89
surprising the crew in a short time the,784.74,5.64,787.5600000000001
ship was theirs,788.04,4.799,790.4395
ship a crew Men Without a country,792.839,4.5,795.089
sailing under the only colors left to,795.42,3.92,797.38
SUNY became Captain blunt known as the,805.2,4.68,807.5400000000001
most courageous and daring pirate in all,807.839,3.12,809.399
the Caribbean,809.88,3.3,811.53
forced by sheer necessity ships of every,810.959,4.38,813.149
nation became his prize but only for the,813.18,5.76,816.06
goal They Carried and not for bloodshed,815.339,6.18,818.4290000000001
never once did he attack a ship flying,818.94,5.82,821.85
the English flag until in the harbor at,821.519,6.06,824.549
larger lay an English frigate of 50 guns,824.76,5.639,827.5794999999999
guarding the slave colony,827.579,5.341,830.2494999999999
he entered into combat at the risk of,830.399,4.62,832.709
losing their ship,832.92,4.14,834.99
their only home,835.019,4.981,837.5095
even possible capture and returned to,837.06,3.48,838.8
his crew proved their worth even when,846.54,4.08,848.5799999999999
the frigate made a futile attempt to Ram,848.76,4.579,851.0495
their ship,850.62,2.719,851.9795
victory was theirs,853.5,5.459,856.2295
they could have ransacked the city for,856.62,5.76,859.5
its gold and its jewels,858.959,4.801,861.3594999999999
but a dawn,862.38,3.899,864.3294999999999
the Victor only demanded the release of,863.76,3.2,865.36
the slaves,866.279,5.161,868.8595
a free man he went back to the practice,875.16,4.76,877.54
it was Isabella you know cousin Don,885.48,3.84,887.4
Ramon and I saw Captain Blood at,887.699,3.601,889.4995
Cartagena wearing the same blue and,889.32,3.3,890.97
silver uniform which he has made,891.3,3.96,893.28
Infamous throughout the Caribbean,892.62,4.44,894.84

gravity of these charges that Captain,2053.919,4.5,2056.169
Evans has brought against you 80 in The,2055.359,5.04,2057.879
Escape of a prisoner of the crown,2058.419,4.26,2060.549
fostering a mutiny aboard the ship Congo,2060.399,4.921,2062.8595
Queen which resulted in his capture by,2062.679,3.72,2064.539
Mutiny treason and Parise have you,2066.399,5.821,2069.3095
nothing to say in your own defense,2069.52,5.46,2072.25
if words can erase some of the dishonor,2072.22,4.619,2074.5294999999996
that your Deeds have brought upon our,2074.98,4.919,2077.4395
name you must speak Isabella,2076.839,5.161,2079.4195
if you have no objection I would like to,2079.899,4.321,2082.0595
have another try at the slave land bring,2082.0,4.639,2084.3195
him forward,2084.22,2.419,2085.4294999999997
on the night Bloods Pirates stole my,2087.22,2.699,2088.5694999999996

to the land well,2098.74,3.08,2100.2799999999997
if your Excellency is unfamiliar with,2103.06,3.779,2104.9495
Spanish those words translated are did I,2104.68,3.54,2106.45
entertain the sailors long enough to,2106.839,3.901,2108.7895
allow the good Captain to be rescued,2108.22,4.32,2110.3799999999997
I think a touch of the Lash might loosen,2110.74,5.06,2113.27
his tongue no doubt,2112.54,3.26,2114.17
the boy is innocent,2116.14,3.56,2117.92
Dodges Isabella,2119.859,5.461,2122.5895
stop it stop,2122.68,4.38,2124.87
s it's always caught and hanged and,2125.32,3.299,2126.9695
Captain Peter blood hanged House of them,2127.06,2.83,2128.475
come lad speak up yes speak slave while,2135.16,5.22,2137.77
you still have a tongue we shall get,2137.98,3.96,2139.96
nothing out of him Hillary he's in need,2140.38,4.26,2142.51
of another dose take him back,2141.94,3.899,2143.8895
no more sagging he had nothing to do,2145.839,4.441,2148.0595
with it it was all my doing I planned,2148.3,3.299,2149.9495
you admit this crime crime,2151.599,6.421,2154.8095000000003
is it a crime to help the man you love,2155.38,4.5,2157.63
he was being sent away an innocent man,2158.02,3.54,2159.79
to stand a hopeless trial and die on The,2159.88,2.699,2161.2295
and why all because of the jealousy of,2162.579,5.341,2165.2495000000004
one man and the greed of another,2165.28,4.74,2167.65
you are hardly qualified to judge,2167.92,4.8,2170.32
between Justice and Injustice you were,2170.02,4.559,2172.2995
under arrest,2172.72,3.48,2174.4599999999996
hit under guard to the viceroy's court,2174.579,4.02,2176.5890000000004
of Portobello there to be sentenced by,2176.2,5.54,2178.97
the Spanish authorities,2178.599,3.141,2180.1695
but if the captain wants to sail into,2198.839,3.76,2200.719
Martinique as a Dutch trading ship,2201.04,4.62,2203.35
that's his business,2202.599,5.881,2205.5395000000003
but covering up our guns in a strange,2205.66,6.439,2208.8795
part is our business and I don't like it,2208.48,6.9,2211.93
ah tell you it's tough often the shape,2212.099,5.081,2214.6395
of a ship is like changing a leopard's,2215.38,2.94,2216.85

the fact that he is a pirate,3946.079,6.601,3949.3795
but you said a pardon there is one small,3948.839,5.52,3951.599

combination of English Canon and Spanish,4138.38,3.54,4140.150000000001

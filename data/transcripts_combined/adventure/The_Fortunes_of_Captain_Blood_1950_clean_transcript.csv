Miguel Nua would be helpless before us,1225.02,3.48,1226.76
at Beauty that's why he kept you a,1226.7,3.12,1228.26
secret from me,1228.5,3.6,1230.3
the Senor is very kind,1229.82,3.9,1231.77
but it's true that Miguel is very fond,1232.1,4.319,1234.2595
of me oh but Peter fond of you it's only,1233.72,4.319,1235.8795
because I'm his closest friend that he,1236.419,4.861,1238.8495
is so helpless see completely it is only,1238.039,4.561,1240.3195

reason for being here I have told you,2067.839,6.0,2070.839
lies lies nothing but lies,2070.419,4.92,2072.879
if you were really a fruit Peddler,2073.839,3.121,2075.3995

and the first moment we met it was too,2120.88,5.88,2123.82
late to me again I know does this seem,2123.16,6.679,2126.4995
like a lie senorita,2126.76,3.079,2128.2995
lie to me the more thing,2129.88,5.52,2132.6400000000003
first you must tell me who was asking,2133.78,2.76,2135.1600000000003
the overseer but let us not talk about,2136.54,4.5,2138.79

did the overseer want to Peter just to,2141.04,5.1,2143.59
know who you are and what you are doing,2143.859,5.941,2146.8295
in life was that all see no I have told,2146.14,5.88,2149.08

you do not trust me I trust you Pepita,2154.54,3.84,2156.46
because I told you before I do not trust,2156.4,3.24,2158.02
Pedro you're not going to go see but I,2159.64,5.0,2162.14
we have found what we lost that is good,2232.5,5.619,2235.3095
whoever your master is he could have,2236.04,4.74,2238.41
taught you to be a little more polite,2238.119,12.381,2244.3095000000003
nothing like a long nap after a,2270.579,3.481,2272.3195
strenuous exercise,2272.32,4.7,2274.67
the it was quite unnecessary for your,2274.06,6.0,2277.06
Associates to go to so much trouble to,2277.02,4.18,2279.11
bring me here,2280.06,3.42,2281.77
after all I am just as anxious to make,2281.2,4.02,2283.21
your acquaintances you are to make nine,2283.48,4.92,2285.94
send your uh send your uh my name is,2285.22,5.34,2287.89
George Fairfax,2288.4,4.8,2290.8
in my line of work one can't be too,2290.56,5.76,2293.44
careful and what exactly is your line of,2293.2,5.78,2296.0899999999997
work senior,2296.32,2.66,2297.65
what are you doing in large senior,2299.38,3.84,2301.3
I sell fruit Persimmons mangoes,2303.22,4.74,2305.5899999999997
pomegranates,2305.859,5.601,2308.6594999999998
and is that all you have for sale,2307.96,3.5,2309.71
everything,2311.74,2.599,2313.0395
I'm afraid we can't do business after,2316.18,4.86,2318.6099999999997
all then if the senior will excuse me I,2318.16,5.34,2320.83
have a sit down Morales,2321.04,4.559,2323.3195
you were a stranger and larger my friend,2323.5,3.78,2325.39
and perhaps you're not aware that the,2325.599,4.26,2327.7290000000003
laws here are very strict,2327.28,5.7,2330.13
for instance the penalty for robbery is,2329.859,5.041,2332.3795
for example suppose you were to have,2334.9,5.82,2337.81
stolen something in mind a ring say or a,2337.0,6.96,2340.48
timepiece or a medallion,2340.72,5.04,2343.24
and were you to be caught with it in,2343.96,2.82,2345.37
your possession,2345.76,3.06,2347.2900000000004
I could have you hanged,2346.78,4.079,2348.8195
it's a very harsh law,2348.82,4.68,2351.1600000000003
sometimes a useful one,2350.859,5.821,2353.7695
and uh what is the penalty for murder in,2353.5,4.98,2355.99
larger well that depends on whether or,2356.68,4.5,2358.93
not the murder is caught,2358.48,4.74,2360.85
for example there was a regrettable,2361.18,5.1,2363.73
death of a local shopkeeper the ship's,2363.22,5.96,2366.2
Chandler just yesterday,2366.28,5.46,2369.01
became too talkative,2369.18,5.14,2371.75
he had to have been almost no questions,2371.74,4.379,2373.9294999999997
about his death,2374.32,5.64,2377.1400000000003
and I do not think there will be any,2376.119,7.021,2379.6295
incidentally if I should shoot rather in,2379.96,4.44,2382.18
my quarters,2383.14,3.18,2384.73
if you happen to be armed there'd be,2384.4,4.56,2386.6800000000003
even less trouble with the authorities,2386.32,4.92,2388.78
but how would I be expected to know that,2388.96,6.88,2392.4
he was holding an unloaded pistol,2391.24,8.119,2395.2994999999996
Muslim however is loaded,2399.94,8.07,2403.975

visibility to stop it I didn't mean this,2819.76,5.88,2822.7000000000003
I know exactly what you meant,2821.98,7.8,2825.88
but isabelita you should dress senor,2825.64,6.179,2828.7295
perhaps you would like a glass of wine,2829.78,3.96,2831.76
bother me if I get one for myself,2833.74,3.5,2835.49
but I stay with the senor,2839.38,7.34,2843.05
perhaps he might need something hi Isaac,2842.44,4.28,2844.58
is this by any chance what you were,2854.74,6.24,2857.8599999999997

are you in love with him,2877.3,2.96,2878.78
I don't know I I'm not sure,2880.54,4.62,2882.85
I suppose I thought he'd take me away,2883.42,3.72,2885.28
from this horrible place,2885.16,3.48,2886.8999999999996
it's unfortunate you picked the wrong,2887.14,2.64,2888.46
I could have told you that,2889.78,4.02,2891.7900000000004
what would a fruit Peddler know about,2893.8,5.279,2896.4395000000004
or are you a pairless in your,2896.8,4.14,2898.8700000000003
you no longer talk like one who are you,2899.079,3.78,2900.969
the moment I found it convenient to be a,2900.94,3.72,2902.8
peddler my uncle would have ways of,2902.859,4.561,2905.1394999999998
discovering your true identity,2904.66,5.159,2907.2394999999997

Fairfax and I began to suspect his true,2919.96,4.139,2922.0295
nature so I left my ship in the Cove on,2921.819,3.601,2923.6195

friend Mr Fairfax put me up to it that's,3134.339,4.801,3136.7395
why he wanted me to go with a girl so I,3136.92,4.08,3138.96
turn you in and we'd split the reward,3139.14,4.38,3141.33

most generous Excellency but perhaps,3199.38,5.04,3201.9
and yet I can't help wondering if she,3202.26,3.18,3203.8500000000004
might not have been returned to the,3204.42,2.699,3205.7695

once myself,3435.24,2.359,3436.4195

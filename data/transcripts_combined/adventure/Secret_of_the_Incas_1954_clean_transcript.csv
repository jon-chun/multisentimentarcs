I'm going to get rich quick how,3441.079,8.161,3445.1595
that tomb they just started to,3446.44,5.399,3449.1395
open inside it there's a hunk of gold,3449.24,6.76,3452.62

me you are going to steal it with all,3461.48,6.44,3464.7
these people watching I have an,3465.0,6.28,3468.14
advantage I know it's there and I know,3467.92,6.679,3471.2595
exactly where they,3471.28,7.44,3475.0
don't suppose I tell them about you you,3474.599,6.281,3477.7395
won't not if you don't want to get sent,3478.72,4.56,3481.0
back to Europe for your,3480.88,4.84,3483.3
troubles your only way out of Peru is,3483.28,4.839,3485.6995
with me the only way I can get the,3485.72,4.48,3487.9599999999996
Sunburst out is with the plane that's,3488.119,6.761,3491.4995000000004
why I needed it I never needed,3490.2,4.68,3492.54
you why didn't you leave me in the,3495.599,7.281,3499.2395
trungle I gave it some thought,3498.119,4.761,3500.4995000000004
you have forgotten something have I the,3506.52,5.68,3509.36
radio if they call any place it will be,3509.799,5.28,3512.439
information about us you forgot about,3512.2,5.96,3515.18
that you know funny thing they tried,3515.079,5.96,3518.059
using the radio just a little while ago,3518.16,3.959,3520.1394999999998
work just lucky I guess,3522.119,4.801,3524.5195000000003
the Inca civilization was beginning to,3545.16,3.72,3547.02
disappear when these objects were made,3546.72,4.879,3549.1594999999998
what about mono's tomb do you expect to,3548.88,5.159,3551.4595
find the Sunburst you know about the,3551.599,5.321,3554.2595
Sunburst a little everyone knows a,3554.039,5.361,3556.7195
little about it the Sunburst was a,3556.92,4.879,3559.3595
legendary treasure of the Incas I have,3559.4,4.56,3561.6800000000003
heard about it you said,3561.799,5.601,3564.5995
legendary I don't believe it exists,3563.96,5.079,3566.4995
I imagine it has long since been melted,3567.4,4.08,3569.44
down and destroyed in archaeology we,3569.039,3.961,3571.0195000000003
soon learn that objects made of ordinary,3571.48,3.72,3573.34
metal Will Survive the years and all of,3573.0,5.64,3575.82
history objects made of gold don't,3575.2,5.04,3577.72
survive those who make,3578.64,5.0,3581.14
them the moral being that Gold's worth,3580.24,6.76,3583.62
melding depends on how you look at it Mr,3583.64,5.36,3586.3199999999997
steel call me,3587.0,6.24,3590.12

at sundown she obeys the Inca laws the,3607.88,5.919,3610.8395
food has something to do with it it's an,3610.96,5.44,3613.68
offering to the mamuna I would love to,3613.799,6.941,3617.2695
see it certainly Harry,3616.4,37.52,3635.1600000000003
the legend is that in's daughter sang,3659.839,3.52,3661.599
this song when she and the virgins of,3661.76,4.37,3663.945
the temple were claimed by the son,3663.359,35.561,3681.1394999999998
they seem very excited and happy these,3811.52,4.64,3813.84
people tomorrow there will be thousands,3814.0,5.44,3816.72
of them finding the mamuno is a great,3816.16,5.919,3819.1195

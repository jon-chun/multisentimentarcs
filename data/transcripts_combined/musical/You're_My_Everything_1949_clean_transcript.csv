age that I was ever young but I fell in,1275.12,5.4,1277.82
love with a mat Idol in my day too but I,1277.48,5.88,1280.42
was a Massachusetts Adams I had to be,1280.52,5.84,1283.44
rushed off to Europe to forget him by,1283.36,4.4,1285.56
the time I'd gotten back i' let my,1286.36,2.88,1287.8
father talk me in thinking the whole,1287.76,2.6,1289.06
thing was an,1289.24,2.76,1290.6200000000001
Hallucination is that what you're going,1290.36,4.4,1292.56

something to say about it parents always,1309.159,3.64,1310.979

every minute getting up at Daybreak I,4237.4,4.44,4239.62
just don't want that for her or for us,4239.84,4.68,4242.18
either we're retired I want her to be,4241.84,4.76,4244.22
like other children she's not like other,4244.52,3.92,4246.4800000000005

tightly but I remember nothing clearly,4493.04,8.08,4497.08

eyes had the fire of,4502.88,7.88,4506.82
surrender and her touch it was,4506.76,8.04,4510.780000000001
tender and I guess in the moment is that,4510.76,9.52,4515.52
you forget about your hat if you go to,4514.8,10.28,4519.9400000000005

make go it I've been living one way too,4923.88,4.2,4925.9800000000005
long with me it's always been work,4926.159,3.241,4927.7795
everything else has just been the side,4928.08,3.559,4929.8595
issue it isn't because I don't want to,4929.4,5.08,4931.94
it's just that I I don't know if I could,4931.639,6.241,4934.7595
change and I know I'd be an awful flop,4934.48,4.28,4936.62

it I didn't say,4980.44,3.48,4982.179999999999
anything Tom John wants to marry me he,4984.92,6.84,4988.34
does that's funny well it might be to,4988.84,5.399,4991.5395
you but it's terribly serious to him,4991.76,4.24,4993.88
he's very much in love with me and he,4994.239,3.0,4995.739
said he's found a new faith in,4996.0,3.84,4997.92
everything all on a account of me how do,4997.239,4.761,4999.6195
feel very constructive I never thought,5002.199,4.561,5004.4794999999995
I'd live to see the day you'd Inspire,5005.4,4.08,5007.44
anybody to do anything but Slug It Out,5006.76,5.24,5009.38
all right go ahead and make fun of,5009.48,5.28,5012.12

involved this time aren't you up to he,5014.76,4.08,5016.8
what are you going to,5017.639,4.201,5019.7395
do I don't know I was rather hoping,5018.84,4.6,5021.14
you'd make up my mind for me like you,5021.84,3.96,5023.82
do sure is funny why do you keep saying,5025.92,5.68,5028.76
that when it isn't funny at all it's,5029.639,4.481,5031.8795
very important I know it is I only meant,5031.6,3.52,5033.360000000001
it's funny,5034.12,3.8,5036.0199999999995
because Anne wants me to marry,5035.12,6.079,5038.1595
does my gosh it sure is funny isn't it,5042.44,7.44,5046.16
why well I don't know it's just funny,5047.239,4.361,5049.4195
that's all well what's so funny about,5049.88,3.92,5051.84
someone wanting to marry me I have a few,5051.6,4.76,5053.9800000000005
good points you know Tommy are you,5053.8,7.08,5057.34
really in love with her up to here,5056.36,7.68,5060.2
oh well I wonder what would happen if we,5060.88,4.759,5063.2595
just over all our principles went ahead,5064.04,3.28,5065.68
and got married anyway you'd stay here,5065.639,3.52,5067.399
in England with John why would I stay,5067.32,3.56,5069.099999999999
here you can't go traing all over the,5069.159,2.921,5070.6195
world and leave your husband at home,5070.88,3.72,5072.74
what kind of a marriage would that be,5072.08,4.84,5074.5
no I suppose,5074.6,5.24,5077.22
not well well what would you do I'd,5076.92,4.6,5079.22
marry an and no I mean who would you,5079.84,3.48,5081.58
dance with well I never thought of that,5081.52,3.24,5083.14
not having you I might try an if she,5083.32,2.919,5084.7795
wants to she loves to dance and shows a,5084.76,4.359,5086.9395
lot of Promise do you really think so,5086.239,5.201,5088.839499999999
yeah I thought she was a little awkward,5089.119,4.881,5091.559499999999
myself so were you when you started well,5091.44,4.239,5093.559499999999
I know it but but it takes years to,5094.0,3.44,5095.72
build a good team you've always said,5095.679,2.96,5097.159
that and there's a lot of excitement in,5097.44,3.4,5099.139999999999
doing it well it just isn't fair Tommy,5098.639,4.56,5100.919
what isn't I'm getting the short end of,5100.84,4.359,5103.0195
the stick what you want me to settle,5103.199,3.48,5104.938999999999
back and get out of the way while you go,5105.199,2.681,5106.5395
off with someone else and have all the,5106.679,3.201,5108.2795
fun I think it's rotten if you Tommy,5107.88,4.04,5109.900000000001
simply rotten I been ask everything's,5109.88,3.6,5111.68
been so perfect we've had a wonderful,5111.92,3.759,5113.7995
life together we've been very successful,5113.48,3.759,5115.3595
how can you even consider breaking it up,5115.679,3.04,5117.1990000000005
and breaking it up for what to get,5117.239,3.641,5119.059499999999
married oh no Tom marriage is a tough,5118.719,3.44,5120.439
business you know what I've,5120.88,2.88,5122.32
responsibilities obligations the home to,5122.159,3.201,5123.759499999999
take care of maybe children to look,5123.76,3.76,5125.64
after imagine being married to someone,5125.36,3.48,5127.099999999999
you're dancing with if either the,5127.52,2.599,5128.8195000000005
marriage or the dancing doesn't work out,5128.84,3.879,5130.779500000001
both of them go confu oh no no Thomas,5130.119,4.881,5132.559499999999
it's a terrible chance to take it is,5132.719,4.281,5134.8595000000005

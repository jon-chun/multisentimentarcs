get popular how do you mean work on them,3335.039,3.121,3336.5995000000003
I thought the songs got popular because,3336.72,3.72,3338.58
people like them oh that's naive how can,3338.16,4.159,3340.2394999999997
people like a song If they don't hear it,3340.44,3.32,3342.1
you got to get the big singers to sing,3342.319,3.48,3344.0589999999997
it first how do you do that oh there's,3343.76,3.839,3345.6795
all kinds of ways and none of them is,3345.799,4.201,3347.8995

me has to do to get a song on a Hit,3350.0,4.079,3352.0395
Parade last week I fell down in front of,3351.559,4.081,3353.5995000000003
dinosaur's Taxi just to get in,3354.079,3.681,3355.9195
conversation with her every Christmas I,3355.64,3.959,3357.6195
got to remember to send Sinatra new bow,3357.76,4.4,3359.96
tie when a band Leader's wife has a baby,3359.599,3.881,3361.5395000000003
I got to stay home with it on the,3362.16,3.919,3364.1195
nurse's night out it's a big question,3363.48,4.079,3365.5195
whether Mery dots would have been a hit,3366.079,3.72,3367.9390000000003
if I hadn't known how to change a,3367.559,4.961,3370.0395000000003
DIY is that a new song you got there,3369.799,5.04,3372.319

me get a tour would you I am not at all,3377.359,5.24,3379.979
niggardly when it comes to the old Peola,3379.88,6.479,3383.1195000000002
Peola it's a technical term forget it,3382.599,6.24,3385.719
the man who wrote this song is starving,3386.359,3.881,3388.2995
in an attic in,3388.839,3.641,3390.6594999999998
Brooklyn his wife ran out on him left,3390.24,4.319,3392.3995
him penless with two kids she even took,3392.48,3.76,3394.36
the piano with her so now I can't write,3394.559,4.8,3396.9590000000003
no more if this song ain't a hit there's,3396.24,6.72,3399.6
only one thing left for this man the,3399.359,6.401,3402.5595
River on the other hand if somebody was,3402.96,4.639,3405.2795
to get a great artist like Emily Edwards,3405.76,3.64,3407.5800000000004
to introduce it with the band on the,3407.599,4.48,3409.839
radio this man's Fortune would be made,3409.4,5.48,3412.14
and his genius preserve for posterity,3412.079,4.24,3414.199
how do you know he ain't another Steven,3414.88,4.04,3416.9

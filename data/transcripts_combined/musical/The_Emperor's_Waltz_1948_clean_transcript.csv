biting a nice little dog if your animal,1446.6,3.48,1448.34
is so clever it should know better than,1448.64,3.0,1450.14
to approach a dog of an entirely,1450.08,3.839,1451.9995
different class all he did is go up to,1451.64,3.84,1453.5600000000002

stinky oh something or other than the,1474.32,4.02,1476.33
Emperor of Austria that is the low bread,1476.299,3.721,1478.1595

over again,5044.98,3.48,5046.719999999999
there was a grand niece of mine who ran,5046.6,3.84,5048.52
away with a fencing master and,5048.46,3.719,5050.3195
archduchess who fell in love with a,5050.44,3.48,5052.179999999999

my grand niece and her fencing Master,5062.98,3.66,5064.8099999999995
what happened,5064.9,4.02,5066.91
few beautiful months in Naples and then,5066.64,4.019,5068.6495
she began to want to go back to the life,5068.92,3.6,5070.72
she had left,5070.659,4.441,5072.8795
There's No Going Back,5072.52,4.679,5074.8595000000005
eventually she threw herself from the,5075.1,4.38,5077.29
fifth Story window of her hotel,5077.199,4.201,5079.299499999999
the archduches with her tourist guide,5079.48,5.28,5082.12
had less luck or less character,5081.4,5.279,5084.0395
she's living still,5084.76,4.32,5086.92
in a cheaper Viennese boarding house I'm,5086.679,4.741,5089.0495
sleeping pills and Brandy anything to,5089.08,3.9,5091.03
forget where she came from where she,5091.42,3.0,5092.92

we are different,5111.76,4.14,5113.83
we are like snails living in lovely,5113.56,4.619,5115.869500000001
Twisted little shells,5115.9,6.6,5119.2
have you ever observed a snail Mr Smith,5118.179,6.661,5121.5095

car netted heads that peer very proudly,5124.84,4.379,5127.029500000001
from their tiny castles,5126.94,5.16,5129.5199999999995
they move with dignity I imagine they,5129.219,4.081,5131.2595
have a great sense of their own,5132.1,2.28,5133.240000000001
importance,5133.3,3.12,5134.860000000001

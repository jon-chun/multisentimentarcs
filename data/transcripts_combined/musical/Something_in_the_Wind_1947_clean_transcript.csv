switchboard that's what I heard and it,395.039,3.901,396.98949999999996

on the switchboard to marry Philip now I,398.94,3.18,400.53
learned you've walked out on marrying,400.979,2.521,402.23949999999996
Philip to go back to a switchboard,402.12,5.359,404.7995

can't we talk about it later I can meet,407.479,4.0,409.479
you at Gustav's dad and I are having,410.22,2.819,411.6295

and wish me luck Mary you did give them,417.9,4.2,420.0
notice when you left the Supreme Court I,419.94,3.599,421.7395
wouldn't want them to think I lured you,422.1,4.26,424.23
away oh it's nothing like that Mary for,423.539,5.641,426.35949999999997
you justice Peabody on five White House,426.36,5.04,428.88
yes please one moment please yes I'll,429.18,4.5,431.43
take care of it right away,431.4,5.16,433.97999999999996
hello Justice Peabody Mary,433.68,5.04,436.2
your decision not to marry Philip is,436.56,4.259,438.6895
your own business and I'd be the last,438.72,3.84,440.64000000000004
one to interfere thank you justice,440.819,3.361,442.4995
Peabody it was very nice of you to call,442.56,4.02,444.57
to tell me so but clarification of a,444.18,4.98,446.67
misunderstanding is not interference and,446.58,4.32,448.74
I happen to know that Philip's,449.16,3.24,450.78000000000003
explanation of what happened the other,450.9,4.019,452.9095
evening is the absolute truth it's no,452.4,3.84,454.32
use your honor I've been through all,454.919,3.541,456.6895
that now just let me handle this Philip,456.24,4.679,458.5795
that Wentworth girl is a witness in an,458.46,4.44,460.68
important government case and Philip was,460.919,4.5,463.169
out with her strictly in his capacity as,462.9,3.98,464.89
an attorney for the justice department,465.419,4.021,467.42949999999996
Justice Peabody the fact that Philip was,466.88,4.12,468.94
out with Miss Wentworth is immaterial,469.44,3.3,471.09
irrelevant and has no bearing on the,471.0,3.479,472.7395
case I'm still not getting married get,472.74,3.66,474.57
the new number for you sir,474.479,3.78,476.36899999999997
I know but,476.4,3.6,478.2
please give that Mr Justice can't we,480.0,3.3,481.65
discuss it some other time,481.5,4.74,483.87
please tonight at Gustav's Goodbye Mary,483.3,4.619,485.6095
but we have no record of anything I'm,486.24,3.66,488.07
afraid there's one point I overlooked,487.919,4.761,490.29949999999997
White House operators are always on call,489.9,5.22,492.51
therefore it's a matter of practice we,492.68,4.959,495.1595
never hire young married women so if,495.12,4.079,497.1595
there's any possibility of your getting,497.639,3.361,499.3195
married in the near future oh but there,499.199,3.361,500.8795
isn't I'm sure everyone's convinced of,501.0,3.66,502.83
that by now well it didn't sound that,502.56,4.5,504.81
way believe me Harkey that's the last,504.66,4.74,507.03000000000003
we'll hear of it Mary for you justice,507.06,4.02,509.07
sorry to interrupt Senator but your wife,511.08,3.839,512.9995
is on the line,513.18,3.719,515.0395
rules are rules and we're not supposed,514.919,3.781,516.8095
to receive any personal calls that's all,516.899,3.721,518.7595
I received all day it's one of my first,518.7,4.38,520.8900000000001
day at the White House wasn't my last,520.62,4.8,523.02
oh fine now we're back to the hiccups,523.08,4.14,525.1500000000001
again I thought you were all calm down,525.42,3.78,527.31
I'm perfect to come and when we get,527.22,4.619,529.5295
inside I'll be even calm sure you will,529.2,4.68,531.5400000000001
I'll hold it Dad see if Phillip's in,531.839,4.161,533.9195000000001
he's there you know what,540.08,4.9,542.5300000000001
let's just wait a few seconds to be sure,542.94,3.959,544.9195000000001
there are no more stray hiccups,544.98,3.24,546.6
knows I only get them when I'm,546.899,2.521,548.1595
emotionally upset and I don't want him,548.22,4.46,550.45
to think I'm upset on account of him,549.42,3.26,551.05
stop worrying Gustav the examination is,554.82,5.579,557.6095
quite simple thousands of people have,558.42,4.26,560.55
passed it and you've still got four days,560.399,4.201,562.4995

mentioned the situation to the justices,874.86,2.94,876.33
this morning I didn't want them to call,876.3,2.4,877.5
your attitude is so ridiculous it's not,878.7,6.72,882.0600000000001
ridiculous jealousy is always ridiculous,881.82,5.16,884.4000000000001

you the reason we're not getting married,886.98,3.18,888.57

even more ridiculous no it isn't look,890.16,4.739,892.5295
Philip when people have known each other,893.04,3.539,894.8095
for a long time and have had a lot of,894.899,3.781,896.7895
dates together there have to become a,896.579,4.141,898.6495
habit with each other I didn't realize,898.68,3.48,900.42
that's what had happened to us until I,900.72,3.059,902.2495
saw you with Miss Wentworth and,902.16,3.119,903.7194999999999

annoyed what's that supposed to prove,905.279,4.321,907.4395
just this a woman shouldn't marry a man,907.26,4.319,909.4195
if she isn't at least a little bit upset,909.6,3.479,911.3395
when he breaks a date with her and goes,911.579,3.181,913.1695
out with another woman a beautiful woman,913.079,3.481,914.8195
and at the time I didn't even know it,914.76,3.3,916.41
was a business date Mary that's a,916.56,3.42,918.27
defense mechanism an unconscious,918.06,3.54,919.8299999999999
manifestation of your jealousy please,919.98,4.2,922.08

while we're on the subject,2401.38,5.26,2404.01
you could have done just as well with me,2403.48,6.509,2406.7345

what was missing 11 o'clock and brother,2452.8,4.86,2455.23
Paxton hasn't called 11 o'clock time for,2454.96,5.52,2457.7200000000003

Paxton calls while I'm out ask him to,2460.48,3.78,2462.37
ask him to call back is she kidding,2464.26,4.579,2466.5495
oh miss Peppertree I was just on my way,2470.74,3.42,2472.45
over the seal,2472.9,2.88,2474.34
the president has an idea something went,2474.16,3.179,2475.7495
wrong last night you didn't sound very,2475.78,3.24,2477.4
convincing over the phone,2477.339,4.081,2479.3795
well to tell you the truth Mr Elwood I,2479.02,3.96,2481.0
had another date and I had to stand him,2481.42,4.62,2483.73
up oh that is serious it wasn't a very,2482.98,5.4,2485.68
nice thing to do,2486.04,3.9,2487.99
he does eh,2488.38,3.3,2490.03
well Mary if the president got you into,2489.94,3.36,2491.62
the situation it's up to him to get you,2491.68,3.54,2493.45
out that's what presidents are for oh no,2493.3,3.24,2494.92
Mr L what I wouldn't think of bothering,2495.22,2.34,2496.39
the president,2496.54,3.6,2498.34
but if you have a spare moment his name,2497.56,4.14,2499.63
is David Paxton and he lives at the,2500.14,4.16,2502.22
Puritan Hotel,2501.7,2.6,2503.0
that's probably for you miss nobody in,2514.66,6.08,2517.7
this town would be calling me,2517.599,3.141,2519.1695
it is for you sir it's the president I,2528.22,5.28,2530.8599999999997
don't know any president,2531.64,3.24,2533.2599999999998
the president,2533.5,5.579,2536.2895
oh no no no no no just a minute,2534.88,6.0,2537.88
Mr President,2540.88,5.42,2543.59
yes this is David Paxton,2542.5,3.8,2544.4
I'd give it a thought Mr President,2549.28,5.1,2551.8300000000004
oh believe me sir it's very unimportant,2551.859,5.041,2554.3795
what I want to discuss is my fish,2554.38,4.739,2556.7495
no f i s h,2556.9,5.959,2559.8795
yes that's right Mr President fish,2559.119,3.74,2560.989
yes she's probably a very nice girl but,2562.9,4.38,2565.09
yes I'm sure she is Mr President but,2567.28,5.339,2569.9495
but what about my fish I can't get near,2570.22,4.379,2572.4094999999998
them on account of the Navy,2572.619,4.681,2574.9595
Mr President don't hang up,2574.599,5.301,2577.2495000000004
Mr President,2577.3,2.6,2578.6000000000004
I didn't want to discuss this in front,2588.04,3.6,2589.84
of the other girls that's why I asked,2590.079,4.02,2592.0890000000004
you to come here yes Mr Ellen,2591.64,4.8,2594.04
I don't know the exact situation between,2594.099,4.02,2596.1090000000004
you and Mr Paxton but if you're,2596.44,3.36,2598.12
entertaining any serious thoughts about,2598.119,3.781,2600.0095
him I'm afraid he doesn't return them oh,2599.8,3.72,2601.6600000000003
but I'm not Mr hellwood but I hardly,2601.9,3.54,2603.67
know him the president will be glad to,2603.52,3.54,2605.29
hear it frankly he wasn't very impressed,2605.44,3.419,2607.1495
with Mr Paxton the young man doesn't,2607.06,5.46,2609.79
seem to be entirely uh rational,2608.859,5.46,2611.589
oh no he didn't talk to the president,2612.52,3.48,2614.2599999999998
about fish,2614.319,4.621,2616.6295
every time your name was mentioned,2616.0,4.5,2618.25
please thank the president for me Mr,2618.94,3.06,2620.4700000000003
Elwood and tell him I don't ever expect,2620.5,3.66,2622.33
to see Mr Paxton again I'm sure the,2622.0,4.319,2624.1595
president will be pleased you see Mary,2624.16,4.86,2626.5899999999997
just between you and me it's the,2626.319,4.381,2628.5095
president's unofficial opinion that Mr,2629.02,3.96,2631.0
Paxton is more or less of a,2630.7,3.59,2632.495
we'll keep the country running till I,2641.4,5.82,2644.31
get back I'll try Mary,2643.54,3.68,2645.38
thanks for the assist with the president,2651.359,3.821,2653.2695

though I didn't get any place,2655.18,3.179,2656.7695

Mr Paxton and I'm sure it's a,2663.4,3.06,2664.9300000000003
fascinating story but I only get one,2664.66,3.78,2666.5499999999997
hour for lunch if I skim over the,2666.46,3.72,2668.32

sardines what is all this about fish in,2716.079,3.361,2717.7595
to begin at the beginning have you ever,2721.06,3.48,2722.7999999999997
heard of Paxton's Encyclopedia of marine,2722.44,3.419,2724.1495
life in the Pacific,2724.54,2.579,2725.8295
he was considered just about the world's,2728.2,3.119,2729.7594999999997
foremostic theologist,2729.7,4.379,2731.8894999999998
about 40 years ago he came across Coco,2731.319,5.881,2734.2595
pangolato at a crystal clear Lagoon,2734.079,4.921,2736.5395000000003
teeming with fish perfect spot for,2737.2,3.96,2739.18
marine laboratory so we bought it the,2739.0,4.26,2741.13
Lagoon Donald the whole island it's just,2741.16,3.72,2743.02
a tiny place with a handful of natives,2743.26,4.74,2745.63
anyway when he died I took over I was,2744.88,4.739,2747.2495
doing a passable job too when the war,2748.0,3.66,2749.83
broke out when I got back four years,2749.619,3.661,2751.4495
later I found the Navy and moved in they,2751.66,2.64,2752.98
wouldn't even let me near the place,2753.28,2.76,2754.6600000000003
didn't you tell them it was your Island,2754.3,4.5,2756.55

every Department in Washington and every,2758.8,3.66,2760.63
Department in Washington kept referring,2760.839,2.76,2762.219
me to every other department in,2762.46,3.18,2764.05
Washington I finally decided to come,2763.599,3.181,2765.1895
here and take it up with a head man,2765.64,2.939,2767.1095
personally now is there anything,2766.78,4.68,2769.1200000000003
unreasonable in that not at all why,2768.579,4.5,2770.829

Honolulu he wrote as many letters as I,2773.079,4.321,2775.2395

naval officer she was ordered to go out,2959.079,3.661,2960.9095
with him by the president or nonsense,2961.06,3.66,2962.89
Philip it's true sir she's out with him,2962.74,4.02,2964.75
again right now not because she wants to,2964.72,3.72,2966.58
but on account of the president oh I'm,2966.76,3.3,2968.4100000000003
sure there's a logical explanation,2968.44,3.659,2970.2695
Philip I'm having dinner at the White,2970.06,3.72,2971.92
House on Sunday and I'll mention it to,2972.099,4.26,2974.2290000000003

good evening,3014.64,2.939,3016.1095
but really I had no idea I'm sure the,3019.579,5.701,3022.4295
president didn't do that,3022.319,2.961,3023.7995
well I'm afraid I can't discuss it over,3030.839,4.98,3033.3289999999997

no thanks seven cups are enough,3044.819,4.861,3047.2495
I have read all the books about the,3049.68,4.62,3051.99
rights of the president bills he can,3052.079,4.561,3054.3595
sign bills he can veto the first,3054.3,3.96,3056.28
baseball he can throw out every season,3056.64,4.02,3058.65
but that in one book it says that he can,3058.26,4.74,3060.63
break up Philip and Mary I don't like to,3060.66,3.959,3062.6394999999998
intrude Manning but will you be much,3063.0,3.66,3064.83
longer oh I'm sorry we've been waiting,3064.619,3.781,3066.5095
for someone but we can get your business,3066.66,3.24,3068.2799999999997
straightened out in the meantime good,3068.4,3.9,3070.35
now as I said before about this treaty,3069.9,3.659,3071.7295
I'm sure you'll find it clearly,3072.3,3.48,3074.04
establishes my legal title to Coco Pango,3073.559,4.441,3075.7795
Otto the Marine laboratory the my father,3075.78,4.819,3078.1895000000004
sorry Jackson is our man,3078.0,5.04,3080.52
I'm telling you this fellow with Philip,3080.599,4.901,3083.0495
I've seen some place but Gustav you must,3083.04,4.92,3085.5
see hundreds of people in here yes but,3085.5,5.16,3088.08
this was some place not here oh here's,3087.96,3.54,3089.73
oh hello Harvey it's Justice sit down,3091.5,4.98,3093.99
nice of you to come and solve this,3094.44,4.02,3096.4500000000003
riddle for us what is this interest of,3096.48,3.599,3098.2795
the president in this Pepper Tree well,3098.46,3.18,3100.05
I'm sure the president didn't think it,3100.079,2.76,3101.4590000000003
was going to become a matter for the,3101.64,2.52,3102.9
Supreme Court he merely became,3102.839,2.461,3104.0695
acquainted with her over the telephone,3104.16,3.3,3105.81
wanted to help her neither of us had any,3105.3,4.68,3107.6400000000003
idea that Mr Manning was concerned we,3107.46,4.02,3109.4700000000003
thought we were protecting her from a,3109.98,3.72,3111.84
very disagreeable young man named Paxton,3111.48,4.74,3113.85
David Paxton oh yes do you know him he's,3113.7,5.28,3116.3399999999997
sitting right over there excuse me,3116.22,5.359,3118.8995
now if you'll just look at this tree I'm,3122.839,3.581,3124.6295
not interested in your treaty I'm,3125.28,2.88,3126.7200000000003
concerned with Mary Peppertree oh for,3126.42,3.24,3128.04
heaven's sakes man and can't you talk,3128.16,3.3,3129.81
about anybody but Merry Peppertree I,3129.66,3.0,3131.16
want to know what's been going on with,3131.46,3.619,3133.2695
you and Mary,3132.66,5.64,3135.48
look Manny I've been accused of having a,3135.079,6.641,3138.3995
one-track mind fish but everybody I run,3138.3,5.1,3140.8500000000004
across in Washington is in much worse,3141.72,3.54,3143.49
shape than I am you people are all,3143.4,3.84,3145.32
suffering from a merry Pepper Tree,3145.26,3.12,3146.82
I'm getting out of this Tom maybe in six,3148.38,3.66,3150.21
months or so you'll have something on,3150.66,5.06,3153.19
your minds besides Mary Peppertree,3152.04,3.68,3153.88
good work Manning that was a fast exit,3161.76,4.02,3163.7700000000004
and a permanent one he's leaving town oh,3163.8,3.24,3165.42
well I guess that solves our problem,3165.78,5.539,3168.5495
good luck with Miss Peppertree thanks,3167.04,4.279,3169.1795
good evening Sam,3171.359,3.421,3173.0695
rather late to be having dinner isn't it,3173.22,3.119,3174.7794999999996
your office told me I'd find a year and,3174.78,3.12,3176.34
I didn't come to eat something wrong,3176.339,4.201,3178.4395
plenty after the way my papers have been,3177.9,4.02,3179.9100000000003
supporting the president he's certainly,3180.54,2.94,3182.0099999999998
picking a final way to show his,3181.92,3.6,3183.7200000000003
gratitude well I don't follow you Sam,3183.48,4.2,3185.58
it's fallington and that pepper tree,3185.52,5.099,3188.0695
girl oh not you too,3187.68,4.8,3190.08
now let's sit down and talk this over,3190.619,4.141,3192.6895
calmly I am afraid I'm getting a little,3192.48,5.04,3195.0
old Sam just where do you fit into the,3194.76,4.38,3196.9500000000003
picture Paddington with my daughter,3197.52,3.839,3199.4395
effectively engaged now all of a sudden,3199.14,4.14,3201.21
two nights in a row he breaks days to go,3201.359,3.96,3203.339
out with a telephone operator and I,3203.28,3.36,3204.96
understand it was the president who,3205.319,3.061,3206.8495
arranged it believe me Sam there's no,3206.64,3.36,3208.3199999999997
cause for concern Miss Peppertree is,3208.38,3.0,3209.88
practically married to that young man,3210.0,3.119,3211.5595
talking to Justice Peabody and why isn't,3211.38,3.54,3213.15
she with him instead of found it stop,3213.119,3.421,3214.8295000000003
worrying Sam's bad for the liver there's,3214.92,3.179,3216.5095
absolutely nothing between Farrington,3216.54,3.36,3218.22
and Miss Peppertree it doesn't look that,3218.099,5.181,3220.6895
way from where I'm sitting huh,3219.9,3.38,3221.59
oh Mr Hill would we wondered what,3223.76,4.12,3225.82
happened to you,3226.619,2.881,3228.0595000000003
good evening Mr Litchfield good evening,3227.88,3.3,3229.53
Thomas I'd like a word with you,3229.5,3.24,3231.12
I can take a hint remember Admiral don't,3232.74,5.04,3235.2599999999998
give up the ship,3235.559,4.641,3237.8795
I did all right with Paxton let me,3243.72,4.16,3245.7999999999997
handle Mary too hello everyone,3245.28,5.64,3248.1000000000004
where's Mr Paxton he left,3247.88,4.54,3250.15
well that's funny he was supposed to,3250.92,3.36,3252.6
wait he couldn't very well I practically,3252.42,3.0,3253.92
threw him up,3254.28,3.36,3255.96
why Philip you knew this was terribly,3255.42,3.72,3257.28
important to him what I'd like to know,3257.64,3.3,3259.29
is why it's so important to you,3259.14,3.66,3260.97
well for only one reason I thought I,3260.94,3.48,3262.68
could help him if you didn't want to you,3262.8,2.58,3264.09
should have said so in the first place,3264.42,3.06,3265.9500000000003
Mary in our opinion you're making a fool,3265.38,3.54,3267.15
of yourself over this Paxton if,3267.48,2.82,3268.89
anybody's making a fool of me it's you,3268.92,2.939,3270.3895
now you put me in such a ridiculous,3270.3,3.12,3271.86
position I can't even try to explain to,3271.859,2.201,3272.9595
that gentlemen goodbye Phillip,3277.079,5.401,3279.7795
this time she's a really man but I,3280.44,3.899,3282.3895

sorry Gustav but there's no reason for,3289.14,3.6,3290.94
me to stay just a moment Thomas Doris,3290.52,3.839,3292.4395
wanted me to remind you that we're,3292.74,3.06,3294.27
expecting you to go to the Opera with us,3294.359,3.181,3295.9494999999997

already invited Miss Peppertree,3297.54,6.24,3300.66
are we oh Sam I'm sure we'll straighten,3300.66,5.159,3303.2394999999997
this out you're better and I wouldn't,3303.78,3.72,3305.6400000000003
count too much on that young man with a,3305.819,3.001,3307.3195
Justice Peabody,3307.5,3.119,3309.0595
stop if this thing is serious between,3310.619,4.44,3312.839
Mary and the lieutenant I'm in a spot,3312.599,5.22,3315.2090000000003
last night I saw him kissing her,3315.059,4.141,3317.1295
last night,3317.819,3.3,3319.469
but when we came downstairs it wasn't,3319.2,4.02,3321.21
the lieutenant she was kissing it was a,3321.119,3.601,3322.9195
different one,3323.22,4.5,3325.47
that's where I saw him oh Paxton he's,3324.72,6.0,3327.72
the different one he is huh,3327.72,5.22,3330.33
the Gustav Mary strikes me as a girl,3330.72,3.72,3332.58
pretty good judgment there must be,3332.94,4.139,3335.0095
something to Paxton we don't see,3334.44,4.5,3336.69
at any rate I'd rather he didn't leave,3337.079,4.201,3339.1795

way and peace with the world I love,3533.099,2.821,3534.5095
and we're gonna go and sit in a stuffy,3535.92,3.78,3537.81
Hall listen to a lot of wailing and,3537.72,3.839,3539.6394999999998
bellowing about who killed whom and why,3539.7,3.78,3541.5899999999997
oh but nobody gets killed in The Barber,3541.559,3.961,3543.5395000000003
of Seville if nobody gets killed it can,3543.48,4.02,3545.4900000000002
be much of an opera,3545.52,4.74,3547.89
I waste our time if it is a beautiful,3547.5,5.04,3550.02
spring evening I catch,3550.26,4.02,3552.2700000000004
where to instead,3552.54,3.9,3554.49
I'm in your hands after all this is your,3554.28,5.16,3556.86
time and I know it like a book page one,3556.44,6.359,3559.6195000000002
Lincoln Memorial page two Jefferson in,3559.44,7.02,3562.9500000000003
the morning page three Arlington,3562.799,7.26,3566.429
page 11. I think I like this the best,3566.46,5.94,3569.43

he's the Mr Fixit of Seville he spends,3599.7,4.619,3602.0094999999997
half his time kibet seeing everything,3603.0,3.24,3604.62
that's going on the other half bragging,3604.319,4.921,3606.7795
about it all in a deep rich baritone,3606.24,4.02,3608.25
the curtain goes up on the first act,3610.26,4.44,3612.48
scene one and the stages I don't have to,3611.94,5.46,3614.67

o'clock this evening Miss Peppertree,4005.24,3.299,4006.8894999999998
Lieutenant Farrington was ordered aboard,4006.559,4.081,4008.5995000000003
the presidential yacht to check supplies,4008.539,3.661,4010.3695000000002
for a trip that won't be made for,4010.64,4.199,4012.7394999999997
another three months that's funny not,4012.2,4.5,4014.45
very it was done deliberately so I,4014.839,3.541,4016.6095
wouldn't be able to keep our date,4016.7,3.3,4018.35
oh that's ridiculous who do a thing like,4018.38,3.9,4020.33
that my friend Mr Litchfield and your,4020.0,4.5,4022.25
friend Mr Elwood it's a conspiracy to,4022.28,4.019,4024.2895000000003
keep us apart and this guy's the Patsy,4024.5,3.539,4026.2695
they're using to do it what are you so,4026.299,3.361,4027.9795

you to split up Marion Farrington,4038.539,3.721,4040.3995
vicious little circle isn't it that's an,4040.039,4.32,4042.199
understatement it really isn't as bad I,4042.26,3.48,4044.0
think you can save your explanations for,4044.359,3.72,4046.219
the switchboard Miss Peppertree you know,4045.74,4.079,4047.7794999999996

Merry-Go-Round only I'm not waiting,4049.819,3.48,4051.5589999999997

you and the Sailor can fight it out the,4057.079,3.96,4059.059
fields wide open,4058.4,4.86,4060.83
Mary well I hope you both are satisfied,4061.039,4.141,4063.1095

he just wants to get his hat,4077.38,4.14,4079.4500000000003
Barry I'm sorry about what happened,4089.119,4.92,4091.579
you know I wouldn't do anything to hurt,4092.66,2.58,4093.95
oh I know that Philip it really wasn't,4095.24,4.32,4097.4
your fault can't understand Paxton,4096.98,4.5,4099.23
taking that attitude understanding his,4099.56,3.42,4101.27
attitudes it's a full-time job and I've,4101.48,3.359,4103.1595
given it up,4102.98,3.839,4104.8994999999995
you know Philip you were right in the,4104.839,3.301,4106.4895
first place I never should have begun to,4106.819,3.121,4108.3795
work on the White House switchboard,4108.14,4.199,4110.239500000001
I was right about other things,4109.94,4.44,4112.16
we're not just a habit with each other,4112.339,3.0,4113.839
We Belong Together,4115.339,5.88,4118.2789999999995
I don't know right now I'm all mixed up,4117.799,4.92,4120.259
you're really an awfully nice person,4121.219,5.04,4123.7390000000005
Philip and well maybe you don't give me,4122.719,4.801,4125.1195
the hiccups but you don't give me any,4126.259,3.121,4127.8195
headaches either,4127.52,3.06,4129.05
I don't want to give you anything but,4129.38,2.879,4130.8195000000005
you get yourself a good night's sleep,4132.259,2.641,4133.5795

good night old man,4142.179,15.12,4149.7390000000005
I thought you'd gone I couldn't,4157.299,5.321,4159.9595
not while I'm still in the doghouse,4160.279,3.661,4162.1095000000005

little misunderstanding,4296.12,3.0,4297.62
White House,4297.98,3.179,4299.5695
Lieutenant Farrington oh but Mr,4299.12,3.599,4300.9195

thank you very much Mary,4312.14,5.22,4314.75
it's no use Harkey you better start,4315.32,4.08,4317.36
looking for another girl looks like I'll,4317.36,4.5,4319.61
just have to marry somebody,4319.4,4.56,4321.679999999999
I'm sorry Mr Litchfield but I have no,4321.86,4.92,4324.32
idea where to locate Mr Elwood,4323.96,4.5,4326.21
yes Mr Litchfield he knows about,4326.78,3.48,4328.5199999999995
farrington's engagement and I assure you,4328.46,3.54,4330.2300000000005
he is just as disturbed about it as you,4330.26,2.64,4331.58
yes Mr Litchfield I'll tell him when he,4332.9,3.839,4334.8195
angry huh steaming,4336.739,4.741,4339.1095
crumbly I don't get it I'm certain that,4338.96,3.96,4340.94
girl is no more in love with Farrington,4341.48,3.36,4343.16
get David Paxton on the phone I'm sorry,4344.84,3.48,4346.58
sir but he's left Washington as a matter,4346.76,3.36,4348.4400000000005
of fact his plane took off just about 10,4348.32,4.02,4350.33
minutes ago oh fine,4350.12,3.9,4352.07
he's my one hope of breaking up this,4352.34,3.78,4354.2300000000005
Farrington thing now he's gone probably,4354.02,3.48,4355.76
on his way out of the country it was,4356.12,2.579,4357.4095
just as well sir he shouldn't have been,4357.5,3.48,4359.24
here in the first place why not that's,4358.699,3.96,4360.678999999999
one of the odd complications I found in,4360.98,3.84,4362.9
this case Sir Mr Paxton is not a citizen,4362.659,3.54,4364.429
technically he's guilty of the legal,4364.82,3.72,4366.679999999999
entry are you sure positive sir I,4366.199,3.121,4367.759499999999
checked with the state department,4368.54,3.54,4370.31
according to his father's treaty details,4369.32,3.96,4371.299999999999
and get me the immigration and,4372.08,3.18,4373.67
naturalization service and then ask Miss,4373.28,4.32,4375.44

of my citizenship you're not being,4433.34,4.44,4435.56
deprived of anything Mr Paxton,4434.9,4.92,4437.36
my virtue of this treaty when your,4437.78,3.84,4439.7
father accepted ownership of cocobango,4439.82,4.08,4441.86
atoll he became a blood brother of the,4441.62,3.84,4443.54
Native King and also renounced his,4443.9,3.36,4445.58
American citizenship oh that's,4445.46,3.48,4447.2
ridiculous I've always considered myself,4447.26,3.899,4449.2095
an American son of my father legally or,4448.94,3.779,4450.8295
not and I'm afraid we have no other,4451.159,3.841,4453.0795
course but to have you deported deported,4452.719,5.041,4455.2395

acceptable but in the meantime Mr Paxton,4495.92,3.96,4497.9
will have to remain in custody,4497.96,3.54,4499.7300000000005

matters for the president,4569.48,2.66,4570.8099999999995
I'm sorry to barge in like this Harvey,4573.44,3.239,4575.059499999999
but I just received a call from the,4575.48,2.58,4576.7699999999995
state department about the deportation,4576.679,3.48,4578.419
of a David Paxton they told me you know,4578.06,4.139,4580.1295
something about it why yes Admiral do,4580.159,3.661,4581.9895
you by any chance also know that,4582.199,3.721,4584.059499999999
kokapango atoll is now called Carlson,4583.82,4.08,4585.86
Island Carlson Island,4585.92,3.84,4587.84
we've got a naval base there has,4587.9,4.2,4590.0
precisely 300 million dollars worth and,4589.76,3.959,4591.739500000001
I hope you realize the significance of,4592.1,2.76,4593.4800000000005
the deportation proceedings against,4593.719,3.181,4595.3095
Paxton if we establish him as a,4594.86,3.6,4596.66
foreigner we establish the island as,4596.9,3.66,4598.73
foreign soil and not part of the United,4598.46,4.14,4600.53
States which means that the Navy is,4600.56,3.119,4602.119500000001
trespassing,4602.6,3.54,4604.370000000001
Great Scott Admiral Paxton never spoke,4603.679,4.741,4606.0495
about anything but studying fish he made,4606.14,4.079,4608.1795
it sound small and unimportant and he,4608.42,3.48,4610.16
certainly never mentioned Carlson Island,4610.219,3.541,4611.9895
that could have been deliberate Charlie,4611.9,3.36,4613.58
I'm afraid you've been taken in by a,4613.76,3.479,4615.4995
smart operator this Paxton has,4615.26,3.12,4616.820000000001
maneuvered the government into a,4617.239,2.341,4618.4095
position where we either have to make,4618.38,3.66,4620.21
terms with him or move,4619.58,3.78,4621.47
we better take this up with the,4622.04,3.44,4623.76

the switchboard,4674.06,4.08,4676.1
David don't tell me something went wrong,4675.32,4.68,4677.66
oh good stuff you didn't refuse him he's,4678.14,5.88,4681.08

the whole Supreme Court coaching me I,4686.0,3.36,4687.68
didn't pass but you knew everything,4687.679,4.681,4690.0195
perfect even better than perfectly I,4689.36,4.799,4691.7595
remembered every word what Justice,4692.36,3.359,4694.0395
Peabody told me about Justice Williams,4694.159,3.301,4695.809499999999
told me about Justice Hastings told me,4695.719,4.141,4697.7895
but Justice van Sloan told me it was so,4697.46,4.14,4699.53
easy and the first question alone I,4699.86,4.14,4701.929999999999
talked for 45 minutes so this man said,4701.6,4.559,4703.8795
come to the point so I came to the point,4704.0,4.44,4706.22
another 20 minutes again he asked me to,4706.159,4.381,4708.349499999999
come to the point so I coming to the,4708.44,4.62,4710.75
point and the second question I didn't,4710.54,4.32,4712.7
even finish what Justice Peabody told me,4713.06,4.02,4715.070000000001
all of a sudden the examination was over,4714.86,4.56,4717.139999999999
the man said I should come back in three,4717.08,4.619,4719.3895
months with shorter answers,4719.42,4.98,4721.91
and that Mary is that,4721.699,4.98,4724.188999999999
we're not linked yet will the justices,4724.4,4.44,4726.62
arrive I'll get them to help us,4726.679,4.141,4728.7495
Mary they are not coming,4728.84,4.26,4730.97
right after my examination I called off,4730.82,3.899,4732.769499999999
the party and reopened for business,4733.1,3.96,4735.08
Justice Peabody promised me he'd be him,4734.719,3.901,4736.6695
and Justice man Sloan I couldn't reach,4737.06,3.0,4738.56
they have an important meeting with the,4738.62,3.84,4740.54
president yes I know I hope he doesn't,4740.06,4.56,4742.34
keep him there all night,4742.46,3.48,4744.2
Paxton's in the driver's seat all right,4745.94,3.06,4747.469999999999
we'll have to make the best deal we can,4747.679,2.821,4749.0895
I guess this is a matter for our office,4749.0,3.6,4750.8
Manning find Paxton and tell him we want,4750.5,3.54,4752.27
to see him hey just a moment this is,4752.6,3.24,4754.22

Paxton when he gets here,4766.219,3.081,4767.7595
Jason look what's the big powwow about,4771.08,5.28,4773.72

with silly technicalities you're the,2754.0,6.42,2757.21
Inspector General be a big strong firm,2756.099,7.041,2759.6195000000002
ladies and gentlemen I have good news,2764.92,2.28,2766.06
the Inspector General has decided to,2767.2,4.379,2769.3894999999998
remain indefinitely,2769.18,3.96,2771.16
he demands an inspection of the,2771.579,3.78,2773.469
financial affairs of Rodney and he will,2773.14,3.719,2774.9995
meet with you at the Town Hall at two,2775.359,2.051,2776.3845
be big be strong be firm says Yakov but,2792.22,5.46,2794.95
if it doesn't work whose neck will they,2795.64,4.99,2798.1349999999998
jerk whose plot will they knock off,2797.68,6.379,2800.8695
be an inspected General,2804.28,4.64,2806.6000000000004
what does An Inspector General do in,2810.46,4.139,2812.5295
inspect generals,2812.5,3.5,2814.25
An Inspector General generally inspects,2816.0,5.8,2818.9
that is they expect them to inspect,2818.92,5.1,2821.4700000000003
generally if they're expecting An,2821.8,4.019,2823.8095000000003
Inspector General,2824.02,3.66,2825.85
but an exceptionally generous Inspector,2825.819,3.54,2827.589
General who made an exception and had no,2827.68,2.939,2829.1495
inspection would cause suspicion which,2829.359,3.781,2831.2495
in my condition I couldn't accept thank,2830.619,3.901,2832.5695
if people unsuspecting now except,2836.26,3.66,2838.09
without detecting an imposter who's not,2838.24,6.599,2841.5395
posted as a pedigreed inspector posture,2839.92,4.919,2842.3795
in two words,2847.18,4.88,2849.62
so it is not a question of truthfully or,2855.18,5.32,2857.8399999999997
not to flee,2858.16,6.32,2861.3199999999997
but to Beyond not to be,2860.5,6.54,2863.77
should I be arrogant should I be elegant,2869.7,7.139,2873.2695
should I be smart,2873.28,7.5,2877.03
a roaring Russian or very British Empire,2876.839,7.601,2880.6394999999998
or like the kg Viennese who already eats,2880.78,5.4,2883.48
a cheese while he says no thank you,2884.44,5.46,2887.17
please be smart,2886.18,7.62,2889.99
I must examine every side of me,2889.9,7.62,2893.71

never touch it,2941.7,7.119,2945.2594999999997

should know they won't know but you,2948.819,3.741,2950.6895

elegant smart if you cease it and it's,2952.56,6.7,2955.91
not so so much so,2957.04,4.34,2959.21
if you talk to them,2959.26,5.64,2962.0800000000004

talk to this unfortunate wretch thing,2981.52,5.42,2984.23
the course of action you should act on,2989.88,5.5,2992.63
that it actually planned is a Smasher a,2992.5,5.28,2995.14
lot of thought I'd put in it if you,2995.38,4.86,2997.81

things are not as bad as they look Gypsy,3100.4,5.07,3102.935
they are much worse,3107.52,6.299,3110.6695

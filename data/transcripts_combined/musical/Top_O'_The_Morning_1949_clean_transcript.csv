single condition but the second,2216.24,3.76,2218.12
condition bryony that he'd come to her,2218.0,4.4,2220.2

under the pocket stained with a blade of,2222.4,4.32,2224.56
grass from the grave of the dead kings,2224.24,4.72,2226.6

air is perfume,2506.319,2.8,2507.719
quiet go get the mail or something,2521.52,5.36,2524.2
you know the first robins came from here,2524.72,4.96,2527.2
so some were caught in far off places,2526.88,4.56,2529.1600000000003
they spoke in the gaelic hardly anyone,2529.68,2.88,2531.12
hey look doesn't all this throw you,2532.56,3.039,2534.0795

lilacs and children's breath and now,2535.599,3.76,2537.4790000000003
there's a routine about robins,2537.2,4.0,2539.2
what nationality would you say a robin,2539.359,2.881,2540.7995
i don't know why i never thought about,2542.24,2.96,2543.72
what good would it do,2543.76,3.76,2545.6400000000003
i suppose it would do no good,2545.2,4.32,2547.3599999999997

around town doesn't cast a shadow do you,2557.76,3.839,2559.6795
have to believe everything,2560.16,2.72,2561.52
sometimes we believe in fairy tales but,2562.88,5.04,2565.4
at least we know their fairy tales,2564.8,4.799,2567.1995
and it's a better way to think of the,2567.92,3.52,2569.6800000000003
fields we'll walk in,2569.599,4.0,2571.599

detest the man and that's the sum of my,3034.72,4.73,3037.0849999999996
observation,3036.559,6.621,3039.8695000000002

sound of which will come from small,3081.599,3.121,3083.1595
places not dreamed of,3083.359,5.961,3086.3395
like from a,3091.359,6.0,3094.359

ah that's a foolish prediction of the,3102.88,3.04,3104.4
foolish way of saying this that's the,3104.559,2.641,3105.8795
way it was given to biddy there's no,3105.92,5.12,3108.48
reason to be obsessed it's but i'm down,3107.2,3.84,3109.12

000 reward for information leading to,3190.079,3.601,3191.8795

something happening here is a circle of,3808.64,2.719,3809.9995
there's always a little circle of people,3811.359,2.96,3812.839
from the air this town must look like a,3812.96,4.24,3815.08
traveling crap game,3814.319,2.881,3815.7595

fell down in the prime of his days,3854.4,4.399,3856.5995000000003
now perhaps certain people would believe,3856.799,3.681,3858.6394999999998
in the accidents,3858.799,5.681,3861.6394999999998

you come on down here and try it on for,3924.4,2.56,3925.6800000000003
it sounds crazy maybe but i gotta hunch,3928.319,4.321,3930.4795
mcnaughton's right,3931.28,3.839,3933.1995
about the accidents being connected,3932.64,4.399,3934.8395
of course he'd be a problem,3935.119,5.121,3937.6795

i'll see you sometime tomorrow then,3940.24,3.44,3941.9599999999996
meantime i got a little snooping around,3942.24,2.879,3943.6794999999997
oh that's the trouble with murder fellas,3946.799,5.04,3949.319
like to lose some of his best friends,3948.799,6.04,3951.819
that his voice will come from small,3969.039,3.76,3970.9190000000003
places not dreamed of what,3970.799,4.401,3972.9995
it's been fulfilled well you know it's,3972.799,4.721,3975.1594999999998
the fifth that counts the most that i,3975.2,4.159,3977.2794999999996
love him or no one at all and the,3977.52,4.96,3980.0
important part if your love is returned,3979.359,6.161,3982.4395
he will tread heavily on your heart,3982.48,4.16,3984.56
ready to be loved in return is there no,3986.64,4.32,3988.7999999999997
way to guarantee it well i could put a,3988.319,4.881,3990.7595
curse on him oh no,3990.96,4.159,3993.0395
no i don't think a curse would be fair,3993.2,2.72,3994.56
besides it does little good to put a,3995.92,3.28,3997.56
curse on americans they don't seem to,3997.52,3.92,3999.48
know the difference,3999.2,3.839,4001.1195
i guess i'll have to prove it in my own,4001.44,4.0,4003.44
way and you'll know be a sign when he,4003.039,4.481,4005.2795
treads heavily on your heart,4005.44,4.48,4007.68
then the next condition will follow,4007.52,4.88,4009.96
he'll bring honor to himself on the nine,4009.92,8.04,4013.94
counties with a deed of great cunning,4012.4,5.56,4015.1800000000003
will you look,4020.16,8.32,4024.3199999999997

fate could you give me a wise word to go,4032.839,3.321,4034.4995
well if he strikes you in the eye with a,4036.16,4.0,4038.16
lump of coal it's a sign you're making,4038.079,3.601,4039.8795
no progress,4040.16,4.08,4042.2
i'll let you know,4041.68,6.399,4044.8795

but mostly for someone we meet,4320.08,3.68,4321.92
too sweet to think,4325.28,4.959,4327.7595
that wherever we roam,4327.44,6.64,4330.759999999999
we're sure to find something blissful,4330.239,5.521,4332.9995
and that when we're far from the lips,4335.76,9.04,4340.280000000001
we we have but to make love,4340.84,7.64,4344.66
to the lips we are near,4344.8,9.48,4349.54
the heart like an ivy accostant,4348.48,5.8,4351.379999999999
let it grow where it will,4354.56,6.639,4357.8795
cannot flourish alone,4357.92,7.239,4361.5395
what will lead to the,4361.199,6.401,4364.3994999999995
nearest thing,4365.159,4.991,4367.6545
it can twine,4367.6,8.87,4372.035000000001
to be sure to find something,4383.679,6.321,4386.8395
still that is dear,4387.04,4.639,4389.3595
and to know,4390.0,3.36,4391.68
from the lips we,4393.36,10.18,4398.45
you're in love with someone,4408.239,6.161,4411.3195
anyone i know,4411.36,6.08,4414.4
like to have his chances,4414.4,6.799,4417.7995
no lucky so and so,4417.44,6.759,4420.8195
if you're in love with someone,4435.12,4.72,4437.48
well where were you going with this,4466.96,3.12,4468.52
on the doorstep,4468.719,2.96,4470.199
for a proud man who might be hungry and,4470.08,4.0,4472.08
passing by,4471.679,3.761,4473.5595
in america do they ever think of the,4475.44,6.36,4478.62
pool oh yes around election time,4476.88,4.92,4479.34
father will be here soon,4488.159,4.401,4490.3595

is to find the stone i have a faint,4492.56,4.159,4494.6395
notion to him at least,4494.239,4.161,4496.3195
for he was never first or bested,4496.719,3.52,4498.479
anything finding the stone will do the,4498.4,3.12,4499.96
that's why i've prayed for it,4501.52,4.719,4503.8795
there's great pain in not being pleased,4504.32,5.76,4507.2
with yourself at least once,4506.239,4.96,4508.718999999999
will you tell him of us if i can squeeze,4511.199,4.641,4513.519499999999

and then did you tell that you'd have to,4549.6,3.84,4551.52
be careful of me that it was a problem,4551.04,3.92,4553.0
wait a minute that isn't what i meant at,4553.44,4.08,4555.48

do no harm and the bullying has been,4560.08,4.96,4562.5599999999995
placed in the job defined,4562.8,4.08,4564.84
i don't understand what is joe to do,4565.04,2.88,4566.48
oh you weren't told,4567.92,3.68,4569.76
he's a detective sent over to find the,4569.76,4.0,4571.76
blarney stone,4571.6,3.76,4573.4800000000005
and he'll find it,4573.76,4.399,4575.9595

plundered known man,4586.48,7.16,4590.0599999999995
because only you would be disappointed,4589.52,4.12,4591.580000000001
and he'll bring honor to himself in the,4606.96,4.239,4609.0795
nine counties with the deed of great,4609.199,4.401,4611.3994999999995

last condition khan,4664.48,6.16,4667.5599999999995

if you should turn him out of your house,4681.28,3.439,4682.9995
and you did that,4683.28,4.24,4685.4
then he will go to the wood of kali,4684.719,4.881,4687.1595
there a song will be sung in the light,4687.52,4.32,4689.68
of the moon,4689.6,6.16,4692.68
your man will die,4691.84,3.92,4693.8
but that's not true there could be no,4696.4,3.52,4698.16
the singer,4699.92,2.88,4701.36
it doesn't mean that exactly for none of,4702.8,3.6,4704.6

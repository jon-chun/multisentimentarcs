having heard so much about you i,1794.08,3.599,1795.8795
expected you to be much older,1795.679,3.841,1797.5995
i'm old enough to appreciate a good,1797.679,4.321,1799.8395
looking girl when i see one,1799.52,6.24,1802.6399999999999
this promises to be quite a trip,1802.0,7.44,1805.72
personally i don't intend to miss a meal,1805.76,6.399,1808.9595
how am i doing,1809.44,2.719,1810.7995

i can't get over that passenger list i'm,1828.0,3.679,1829.8395
calling a young boy,1830.399,3.361,1832.0794999999998
mister my girl could waste a whole trip,1831.679,3.921,1833.6395
to europe if she trusted a passenger,1833.76,2.48,1835.0
then you think we better give up the,1836.24,4.319,1838.3995
whole idea huh only he was 16 or 17 even,1837.52,4.879,1839.9595
you could marry him in tennessee,1840.559,4.0,1842.559
seemed a good idea to bring some drinks,1842.399,3.681,1844.2395
here are your cigarettes oh you're a,1844.559,2.881,1845.9995
dear good boy,1846.08,3.36,1847.76
i've been wondering what's your line mr,1847.44,4.16,1849.52
malone my line,1849.44,4.239,1851.5595
well my most effective one is to tell a,1851.6,4.079,1853.6395
girl that she has hair like a tortured,1853.679,3.201,1855.2795
lips like a red couch in an ivory palace,1856.88,6.72,1860.24
and i'm lonely and starved for affection,1860.159,6.081,1863.1995000000002
then i generally burst into tears very,1863.6,3.84,1865.52
seldom works,1866.24,3.919,1868.1995
you idiot no i mean what you do for a,1867.44,3.839,1869.3595
oh that kind of a line nothing i'm,1871.279,3.441,1872.9995
just flip coupons and live off the fat,1874.72,3.439,1876.4395
of the land,1876.559,4.081,1878.5995
coupons that's like money isn't it i'm,1878.159,4.081,1880.1995000000002
very similar,1880.64,3.279,1882.2795
i'm so pleased dorothy's taken an,1882.24,3.679,1884.0795
interest in you i mean she's never been,1883.919,3.841,1885.8395
interested in anyone worthwhile,1885.919,4.801,1888.3195
no taste eh no i'm a hobo collector i,1887.76,4.56,1890.04
might even find room for you,1890.72,4.0,1892.72
she's joking mr malone i hope not i'm,1892.32,3.68,1894.1599999999999
kind of counting on it,1894.72,2.959,1896.1995
some people don't catch on to dorothy's,1896.0,4.08,1898.04
jokes i'm gonna try,1897.679,4.961,1900.1595
that's good dorothy's the best and,1900.08,5.04,1902.6
lordless friend a girl ever had,1902.64,5.12,1905.2
she'll make some man a wonderful wife,1905.12,4.48,1907.36
you'll find out,1907.76,5.36,1910.44
well i've got to be going going where,1909.6,5.919,1912.5594999999998
don't worry about me i'm only concerned,1913.12,3.84,1915.04
about you two,1915.519,3.841,1917.4395
there's a wonderful moon out tonight,1916.96,3.12,1918.52

well pleased if you will,1923.679,3.36,1925.3590000000002
thank you ever so i'd love to fact is if,1924.799,3.36,1926.479
you hadn't asked me,1927.039,3.12,1928.599
i was going to ask you really we'll buy,1928.159,3.041,1929.6795000000002

i say will you excuse us,1931.2,9.599,1935.9995000000001
do you remember last night very well no,1940.799,4.72,1943.1589999999999
i mean when we were talking about the,1943.919,3.681,1945.7595000000001
you said it reminded you of a moon you'd,1947.6,3.76,1949.48
seen in coney island,1949.36,4.64,1951.6799999999998
well it could have been the same way why,1951.36,5.039,1953.8795
well i remember then i was wondering,1954.0,4.159,1956.0795
what a rich young man like you were,1956.399,4.0,1958.399
doing in coney island,1958.159,5.041,1960.6795000000002
oh well i rather that you'd be in,1960.399,3.921,1962.3594999999998
bermuda or,1963.2,14.64,1970.52
palm beach,1964.32,13.52,1971.08
i wonder if i should go in and break,1978.24,4.4,1980.44
that up you're just dancing,1979.679,5.521,1982.4395000000002
out in public can't make much of a case,1982.64,3.68,1984.48
out of that,1985.2,4.959,1987.6795
you sound like a on detective,1986.32,5.839,1989.2395
go find our moon and forget about your,1990.159,3.36,1991.8390000000002
girlfriend,1992.159,2.88,1993.5990000000002
anyway i'd probably get in trouble if i,1993.519,3.201,1995.1195
push piggy overboard,1995.039,6.081,1998.0795
not with me anyway why blame piggy,1996.72,8.24,2000.84
it's not all his fault no i,2001.12,7.039,2004.6395
just what did you mean by that remark,2004.96,5.28,2007.6000000000001
well let's say i just can't figure out,2008.159,4.4,2010.3590000000002
how two girls can be so different,2010.24,4.88,2012.68
be such good friends now listen malone,2012.559,4.161,2014.6395

the coconut shells ward off the snakes,2099.76,3.52,2101.5200000000004

really interesting men,2109.599,5.201,2112.1995
sometimes my brain gets real star poor,2111.599,5.841,2114.5195000000003
little thing it's a terrible thing to be,2114.8,3.76,2116.6800000000003

me why what were you and piggy doing in,2150.96,4.32,2153.12
here before he started barking like a,2153.52,4.48,2155.7599999999998
seal he wasn't barking at swahili no no,2155.28,5.36,2157.96
before that now think hard was there,2158.0,4.16,2160.08
anything that would look incriminating,2160.64,2.56,2161.92
in a photograph,2162.16,2.72,2163.52
something you wouldn't want mr esman to,2163.2,3.04,2164.72
see why no,2164.88,5.92,2167.84
oh my goodness yes what,2166.24,7.2,2169.8399999999997
piggy was telling me about south africa,2170.8,4.72,2173.1600000000003
it's very dangerous there,2173.44,3.919,2175.3995
practically full of snakes called,2175.52,3.04,2177.04
and it seems a python can grab a goat,2178.56,6.96,2182.04
and kill it for just squeezing it to,2182.72,3.6,2184.52
we'll get to the point that's all,2186.32,6.08,2189.36
well what's incriminating about that,2189.44,4.159,2191.5195
piggy was being the python and i was a,2193.599,3.76,2195.4790000000003
oh lorelai don't worry,2197.359,5.121,2199.9195
peggy won't tell anyone he was being the,2200.64,4.959,2203.1195
python he won't have to,2202.48,4.879,2204.9195
because just about the time piggy was,2205.599,3.76,2207.4790000000003
squeezing the goat mr ernie malone was,2207.359,3.441,2209.0795
taking pictures right through that,2209.359,3.281,2210.9995
whatever for the national geographic,2212.64,5.28,2215.2799999999997
oh wake up honey mr malone has foxed us,2217.92,6.24,2221.04
he's been shining up to me so he could,2222.4,3.36,2224.08
keep tabs on you,2224.16,3.28,2225.7999999999997
i'll bet you anything he's a private,2225.76,5.12,2228.32
detective hired by mr esmond,2227.44,6.639,2230.7595
oh gus is jealous without pictures,2230.88,5.199,2233.4795
if he sees that when he'll be absolutely,2234.079,3.121,2235.6395
unreasonable,2236.079,3.921,2238.0395000000003
yes he will,2237.2,2.8,2238.6
i was going to crack malone's head in,2241.04,3.039,2242.5595
but i thought better of it,2242.72,3.44,2244.4399999999996
what do you mean better well we'll have,2244.079,3.121,2245.6395

boy will i tell that stinker off when we,2261.52,3.76,2263.4

my word by charge i must say this is the,2838.56,5.44,2841.2799999999997
most contemptible bit of impudence i've,2841.92,3.679,2843.7595
ever encountered the idea of,2844.0,3.2,2845.6
photographing innocent people through a,2845.599,2.561,2846.8795
why it's absolute invasion of privacy,2848.16,4.64,2850.48
just imagine some newspaper getting a,2850.96,2.72,2852.32
hold of it,2852.8,2.64,2854.1200000000003

that would take advantage of a thing,2869.76,3.04,2871.28
she'd have to be a pretty terrible girl,2872.8,3.759,2874.6795
to be mean to a,2875.44,4.24,2877.56
sweet intelligent generous man like you,2876.559,3.681,2878.3995

a kiss may be grand,4101.44,5.6,4104.24
but it won't pay the rattle on your,4104.719,4.241,4106.8395
humble flat,4107.04,5.279,4109.6795
or help you at the automat,4108.96,6.879,4112.3995

young lady we're here to dispense,4174.48,4.16,4176.5599999999995

oh no sir i did not steal it,4190.239,6.321,4193.3994999999995
the fact is lady big man's husband,4193.359,5.121,4195.9195
gave it to me your honor i'd like to,4196.56,7.28,4200.200000000001
give some information the defendant here,4198.48,5.36,4201.16
you have evidence that affects this case,4204.0,3.6,4205.8
yes or i have,4206.8,3.359,4208.4795
yeah how it means your honor before he,4207.6,4.24,4209.72
talks could i explain something,4210.159,5.921,4213.1195
go ahead mislead well i have a friend,4211.84,6.72,4215.2
named dorothy and she's a really good,4216.08,3.52,4217.84
and dorothy knows that i would never do,4219.6,4.079,4221.6395
anything that was really wrong,4221.6,4.96,4224.08
miss lee do you have to say this oh yes,4223.679,5.441,4226.3995
there's a certain young man that dorothy,4229.12,3.84,4231.04
likes in fact she's,4231.12,5.2,4233.72
very fond of him and dorothy would,4232.96,6.4,4236.16
never speak to this man again if he ever,4236.32,3.44,4238.04
anything to hurt me laura lie,4239.76,5.28,4242.400000000001
so i think this young man had just,4243.04,3.76,4244.92
better know that,4245.04,4.96,4247.5199999999995

changed my mind,4260.96,4.0,4262.96
what i haven't anything to say,4261.92,6.96,4265.4
oh this becomes more and more confusing,4264.96,7.199,4268.5595
but the solution is simpler,4268.88,6.319,4272.0395
my decision is this the property in,4272.159,4.801,4274.559499999999

you don't fool me one bit i'm not trying,4487.04,4.4,4489.24
but i bet i could though no you might,4491.44,3.68,4493.28
convince this,4494.0,2.56,4495.28
jackass that you love him but you'll,4495.12,4.4,4497.32
never convince me that's too bad,4496.56,5.92,4499.52
because i do love him certainly for his,4499.52,3.76,4501.400000000001
no honestly have you got the nerve to,4503.28,4.64,4505.599999999999
stand there and expect me to believe,4506.48,3.44,4508.2
that you don't want to marry my son for,4507.92,2.96,4509.4
it's true then what do you want to marry,4510.88,3.44,4512.6
i want to marry him for your money there,4514.32,6.72,4517.679999999999
oh lord a lie don't you see that's why,4518.56,3.76,4520.4400000000005

silly well at least we're getting down,4522.32,3.2,4523.92
to brass tacks,4524.4,3.52,4526.16
you admit that all you're after is money,4525.52,4.159,4527.5995
no i don't,4527.92,4.88,4530.36
aren't you funny don't you know that a,4529.679,4.48,4531.919
man being rich,4532.8,3.84,4534.72
is like a girl being pretty you might,4534.159,4.241,4536.2795
not marry a girl just because she's,4536.64,2.64,4537.96
but my goodness doesn't it help and if,4539.28,4.24,4541.4
you had a daughter,4542.32,2.96,4543.799999999999
wouldn't you rather she didn't marry a,4543.52,3.679,4545.3595000000005
poor man but i was you'd wanted to have,4545.28,2.399,4546.4794999999995
wonderful things in the world and to be,4547.679,3.52,4549.439
very happy,4549.84,3.6,4551.64

they told me you were stupid you don't,4557.44,3.52,4559.2
sound stupid to me,4559.679,3.841,4561.5995
i can be smart when it's important but,4560.96,4.48,4563.2
most men don't like it,4563.52,5.04,4566.040000000001
except gus he's always been interested,4565.44,4.239,4567.559499999999
in my brains,4568.56,4.0,4570.56
no no that much of a fool he's not,4569.679,4.881,4572.1195

three minutes alone run along darling,4586.56,3.92,4588.52

a great deal to consider i just can't,4594.0,4.96,4596.48
please take your places,4608.88,14.96,4616.36
remember honey on your wedding day it's,4625.679,3.581,4627.4695
all right to say yes,4627.28,7.28,4630.92

from little rock,4638.56,3.28,4640.200000000001
and we lived on the wrong side of the,4642.48,6.08,4645.5199999999995
but at last we won the big crusade,4650.239,14.401,4657.4394999999995
looks like we finally made the grape,4654.719,22.121,4665.7795

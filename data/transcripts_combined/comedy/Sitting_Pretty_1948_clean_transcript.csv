with the housework and sit with my,1515.419,4.561,1517.6995000000002

my room but but my husband isn't home,1552.44,4.5,1554.69

indifference to me,1556.94,3.3,1558.5900000000001
I take the juvenile retaining my,1558.559,3.6,1560.359

breakfast I'm gonna kick him out right,1784.279,4.441,1786.4995
on his ear I guess you're right but,1785.72,5.699,1788.5695
you'll have to tell him he scares me,1788.72,5.939,1791.6895
I think he's kind of cute me too well I,1791.419,4.14,1793.489
and genius or no genius I'm glad I'm,1795.559,3.061,1797.0895
telling to get down here to breakfast,1797.48,2.819,1798.8895
I'll go with you now you boys sit down,1798.62,4.34,1800.79
and finish your breakfast,1800.299,2.661,1801.6295

difference he's going anyway,1825.26,2.899,1826.7095
it's not a sound he's probably still,1832.58,4.16,1834.6599999999999
Mr Belvedere,1836.96,4.02,1838.97
maybe he's gone,1839.36,4.58,1841.6499999999999
good morning oh uh we're sorry to dash,1857.48,6.72,1860.84
in on you like this but we did knock I,1861.26,4.86,1863.69
don't doubt it Mrs King when I practice,1864.2,3.78,1866.0900000000001
my yoga I'm completely out of this world,1866.12,4.62,1868.4299999999998
I neither see nor hear a thing I take it,1867.98,5.34,1870.65
back for somebody yes and the sooner you,1870.74,4.14,1872.81
come down the sooner I'll be with you in,1873.32,4.219,1875.4295
a minute Mr King,1874.88,2.659,1876.2095000000002
now look here you,1878.12,4.799,1880.5194999999999
it's no use dear he's out of this world,1882.919,6.681,1886.2595000000001
he told you oh that's so stupid,1885.2,4.4,1887.4
I never heard of such thing,1890.059,3.381,1891.7495
don't do that little boy,1900.26,3.32,1901.92
this is a rule,1910.399,2.841,1911.8194999999998
now look here Mr Belvedere a joke is a,1914.24,5.28,1916.88
joke but this can't go on,1916.7,4.62,1919.01
and by not Mr King,1919.52,3.48,1921.26
I am perfectly willing to carry out my,1921.32,3.479,1923.0594999999998
end of our agreement I see no reason why,1923.0,3.72,1924.86
you should have fault on yours but it's,1924.799,4.021,1926.8095
obviously impossible you couldn't do the,1926.72,4.38,1928.91
things we require for instance could you,1928.82,5.099,1931.3695
uh bathe Ronnie for many years I have,1931.1,4.74,1933.4699999999998
successfully bathed individuals of all,1933.919,4.021,1935.9295000000002
ages and Sexes and I've never had any,1935.84,4.579,1938.1295
complaints,1937.94,2.479,1939.1795
hey baby don't do that again that's,1942.559,6.48,1945.799
enough Roddy now stop it stop,1946.58,6.18,1949.6699999999998
my wife tells me that uh you're a genius,1949.039,6.38,1952.229
that is correct,1952.76,5.039,1955.2795
if I'm not too inquisitive do you mind,1955.419,5.441,1958.1395
telling me what form it takes,1957.799,5.821,1960.7095
I am in my way a philosopher,1960.86,8.059,1964.8895
always saying you just sit and think,1963.62,5.299,1966.2694999999999
if more people just sat and thought the,1970.76,3.6,1972.56
world might not be in the stinking mess,1972.799,3.841,1974.7195
that it is,1974.36,4.86,1976.79
well maybe you've got something there,1976.64,5.759,1979.5195
to Mr Belvedere can you really handle,1979.22,6.72,1982.58
children amen Mrs King as I told you,1982.399,4.741,1984.7694999999999
last night had a slight children,1985.94,3.479,1987.6795
intensely and yours if I may say so have,1987.14,3.899,1989.0895
been usually repulsive habits and,1989.419,2.821,1990.8295
however I assure you that I can cope,1992.24,3.9,1994.19
with them successfully with a free hand,1993.679,4.88,1996.1190000000001
gesundheit,1996.14,5.34,1998.8100000000002

or two we can try at least the children,2038.38,5.179,2040.9695000000002

your son has been petting me with cereal,2052.3,4.5,2054.55
I have taught him an object lesson and,2054.52,4.98,2057.0099999999998
as you will observe he doesn't like it I,2056.8,3.839,2058.7195
guarantee that he will never throw,2059.5,5.48,2062.24
cereal at me or anyone else again ever,2060.639,4.341,2062.8095000000003

there standing on a head they love him,2122.32,3.42,2124.03
they've been as good as gold all day no,2123.7,3.54,2125.47
kidding they ate their lunch without a,2125.74,3.42,2127.45
single argument he gave Roddy a bath and,2127.24,4.26,2129.37
they wasn't a peep out of him and look,2129.16,4.98,2131.6499999999996

the blink for days well I'll be,2134.14,4.28,2136.2799999999997
what's the matter with Henry is he sick,2144.52,5.04,2147.04
no darling it seems that Mr Belvedere,2146.5,4.619,2148.8095
used to be a dog trainer or something,2149.56,3.36,2151.24
and he had a long talk with Henry this,2151.119,3.24,2152.739
morning and ever since Henry has been,2152.92,3.84,2154.84
quiet as a mouse isn't it wonderful it,2154.359,4.5,2156.609
sounds like a treasure oh he is and in,2156.76,3.96,2158.7400000000002
addition to everything else he makes the,2158.859,3.901,2160.8095
most Divine combination salads you ever,2160.72,3.42,2162.43
looks delicious,2164.14,4.26,2166.27
it's just one thing he's sort of,2166.66,3.66,2168.49
mysterious,2168.4,4.32,2170.56
how do you mean well three times today,2170.32,3.96,2172.3
when he finished his chores he went,2172.72,3.54,2174.49
upstairs and locked himself in his room,2174.28,4.26,2176.4100000000003
I heard the lock click I went up and,2176.26,4.5,2178.51
listened but I couldn't hear a sound,2178.54,5.4,2181.24
what do you suppose he does up there,2180.76,4.859,2183.1895000000004
maybe he stands on his head that doesn't,2183.94,3.419,2185.6495
make much noise oh,2185.619,3.781,2187.5095
is he up there now no he's out taking,2187.359,4.201,2189.4595
his constitutional,2189.4,4.86,2191.83
then why are we Whispering oh I forgot,2191.56,4.68,2193.9
he says he goes out for a constitutional,2194.26,5.0,2196.76
every night before dinner,2196.24,3.02,2197.75
I gave him a key to his room of course,2201.76,2.88,2203.2000000000003
but he doesn't know that I've got an,2203.32,3.9,2205.27
extra one would it be very unethical it,2204.64,4.74,2207.0099999999998
most certainly would,2207.22,4.82,2209.6299999999997
turns all right but nothing happens or,2215.32,5.6,2218.1200000000003
here clumsy let me do it,2217.42,3.5,2219.17

hello can you hear me knowing human,2231.96,5.5,2234.71
nature as I do I suspected that you,2235.48,3.48,2237.22
might try to Snoop,2237.46,4.56,2239.7400000000002
this is a new lock but but it can't be,2238.96,4.619,2241.2695
and order a locksmith it wasn't,2242.02,4.2,2244.12
necessary Mrs King I am an expert,2243.579,5.361,2246.2595
I don't know darling he may be all right,2252.579,5.221,2255.1895
but let's face it he is a screwball,2255.339,5.041,2257.8595
Harry how can you say that he may be a,2257.8,5.1,2260.3500000000004
little eccentric father,2260.38,4.88,2262.82
ER says cleanliness is Next to Godliness,2267.0,6.579,2270.2895

address me as Mr Belvedere until I grant,2313.359,4.5,2315.609
you permission to drop the title a,2316.06,4.26,2318.19
contingency which seems hardly likely Mr,2317.859,5.581,2320.6495
Appleton oh well really I I intended no,2320.32,6.36,2323.5
offensive tell me Mr Belvedere are you,2323.44,4.919,2325.8995

mother is always saying good servants,2340.42,4.14,2342.4900000000002

next time your parent makes that,2344.56,3.0,2346.06
original observation tell her it's one,2345.82,4.38,2348.01

if he's doing anything illegal up there,2453.46,3.42,2455.17

rumors about a drunken or Junior night,3503.16,3.78,3505.0499999999997
clothes with Belvedere is somewhat,3505.319,4.981,3507.8095
garbled but so that's it Mr Appleton's,3506.94,5.58,3509.73
fine hand but my gosh when I came in the,3510.3,3.48,3512.04
house just now you were practically,3512.52,3.299,3514.1695
holding him in your arms For Heaven's,3513.78,4.26,3515.9100000000003

shut up and listen I've been listening,3520.859,4.26,3522.989
all I can hear is a typical Suburban,3522.96,3.839,3524.8795
husband reacting in a typically stupid,3525.119,3.661,3526.9495
and stuffy manner to a typical Tempest,3526.799,4.381,3528.9895
and a teapot he's right and as for that,3528.78,4.62,3531.09
drunken orgy you were talking about Tony,3531.18,3.6,3532.98

Madness and I wasn't in the house a half,3536.819,3.361,3538.4995
an hour when that horrible little Mr,3538.319,4.8,3540.719
Appleton came snooping around,3540.18,4.679,3542.5195
well I imagine it was something like,3544.859,3.901,3546.8095

might be simpler for everybody all,3559.14,4.86,3561.5699999999997
around if if Mr Belvedere sought,3560.819,5.701,3563.6695
employment elsewhere in other words to,3564.0,4.44,3566.22
satisfy malicious gossips like Mr,3566.52,3.96,3568.5

those connected with the firm and their,3974.94,4.44,3977.16
families never to incur the slightest,3977.099,4.26,3979.2290000000003
gossip of a scandalous nature,3979.38,3.78,3981.27

Chicago I do not harp that was quite a,3984.539,5.941,3987.5095
while ago I am now referring to an,3987.839,4.081,3989.8795
incident which took place only last,3990.48,3.839,3992.3995
night a most deplorable incident which,3991.92,4.26,3994.05
has just come to my ears,3994.319,5.101,3996.8695
involving whom involving your wife Harry,3996.18,6.6,3999.48

immediately Miss purely coincidental Mr,4052.16,4.439,4054.3795
King but most enjoyable then you admit,4054.14,5.88,4057.08

stock of hummingbird Hill why Mr Hammond,4068.42,4.56,4070.7000000000003

stop shredding that lettuce,4074.24,5.099,4076.7895

together and apologize to both of us for,4084.799,5.941,4087.7695
this ridiculous scene apologize I should,4087.14,4.86,4089.5699999999997

Discretions,4092.0,4.5,4094.25
very well until you come to your senses,4093.799,4.44,4096.019

behaving more foolishly but Mr King I,4109.16,4.5,4111.41
think you have a slight Edge you keep,4111.739,3.741,4113.6095

apology if she thinks I'm going to come,4150.92,3.48,4152.66
crawling on my knees to ask forgiveness,4152.839,3.48,4154.579

I'm going out and get good and drunk,4156.319,3.781,4158.209500000001

oh Harry doesn't write I I don't even,4179.179,5.16,4181.759
expect to hear from him well of course,4182.0,5.4,4184.7

door when the mail comes or when the,4187.4,3.779,4189.2895
telephone rings,4188.96,4.259,4191.0895

with ridiculous suspicion and jealousy I,4209.42,4.5,4211.67

the first volume of a Trilogy I estimate,4980.3,4.74,4982.67
the other two volumes will take me about,4983.3,4.62,4985.610000000001
and you're going to write them here,4987.92,4.86,4990.35
posterity will demand that the entire,4992.78,3.66,4994.61
Masterpiece be written under the same,4994.76,4.979,4997.2495
roof this house will become a shrine,4996.44,6.6,4999.74
I'm surprised you even want to stay it,4999.739,6.181,5002.8295

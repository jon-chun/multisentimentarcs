they prove that only 23 percent of the,203.879,4.681,206.21949999999998
formula is being assimilated oh the,206.459,4.321,208.61950000000002
formula well you know what that means,208.56,6.66,211.89000000000001

I guess as far as having some little,222.12,3.119,223.67950000000002
effect on those chimpanzees we're,223.62,3.6,225.42000000000002

the equivalent of 84 years old in a,247.319,2.7,248.66899999999998
the formula cure is rheumatism,250.019,4.8,252.419

should be Edwina it must have been,258.72,4.32,260.88000000000005
before you're satisfied with it they,260.699,4.801,263.09950000000003

just got to find a way to make it more,265.5,3.0,267.0
easily Assemble,266.699,5.341,269.3695
a similar box more easily assimilate,268.5,5.88,271.44
similarly oh yeah,272.04,3.719,273.89950000000005

being a chemist you know you can't,284.759,4.681,287.09950000000003
actually think every now and then you'll,287.04,3.78,288.93
feel compelled to sit and stare at a,289.44,2.759,290.8195
sheet of white paper hoping it'll speak,290.82,4.28,292.96
to you but it never does,292.199,2.901,293.6495

whole pretty sad group you get me some,410.52,4.44,412.74
soup plates darling,412.44,4.68,414.78

certain morbid changes as it matures I,417.12,3.419,418.8295
ask you to recall the night of the,419.28,3.06,420.80999999999995

together different reason tonight we're,453.599,3.361,455.2795

what's this message about not going out,480.419,2.641,481.73949999999996
that's right why,483.06,3.72,484.92
sometimes are things more important than,484.8,3.36,486.48
going to a dance,486.78,3.84,488.7
oh the genius at work again man I'm glad,488.16,4.439,490.3795

I've got a few things to say to him,494.039,5.641,496.85949999999997
this has happened just once too often,497.16,4.68,499.5
now look here double Dome what's the,499.68,3.54,501.45

a new dress and I've booked the table it,518.159,4.641,520.4795

he can't take it to the party tonight,543.959,2.761,545.3394999999999
and dance all over your feet as he did,545.1,3.0,546.6
the last time well I certainly didn't,546.72,2.88,548.1600000000001
reserve a table and order flowers and,548.1,3.6,549.9

effective darling I think you solved the,582.0,4.2,584.1
problem for me do you really think so,584.339,3.781,586.2295

increase the efficiency of the formula,751.86,3.719,753.7195
could be quite a thing you know I,753.66,3.06,755.1899999999999
stumbled onto something last night that,755.579,3.121,757.1395
may be of help well that's good news,756.72,4.2,758.82
oh I wanted you to see this advertising,758.7,4.86,761.13
layout I want your opinion we jumped the,760.92,4.08,762.9599999999999
gun on it a little but I thought we'd,763.56,3.6,765.3599999999999
better be ready,765.0,6.48,768.24
well well why before B4 as in before and,767.16,8.66,771.49
after emphasizes the youth angle get it,771.48,6.84,774.9
what's the vote you're doing that's a,775.82,4.9,778.2700000000001
phoenix a mythical bird rising out of,778.32,3.84,780.24
the ashes of age,780.72,3.84,782.64
makes the youth Point again dignified,782.16,4.739,784.5295
yet forceful and do you mind the comment,784.56,4.62,786.8699999999999
Mr Oxley not a tour and welcome I think,786.899,4.321,789.0595
it's appalling from what point of view,789.18,4.32,791.3399999999999
well it's lurid and inaccurate it,791.22,3.54,792.99
implies that we're going to offer the,793.5,2.82,794.91
public some sort of Fountain of Youth,794.76,3.78,796.65
drug but wouldn't it make people Young,796.32,5.16,798.9000000000001
Mr Oxley we're working with a large,798.54,4.919,800.9995
number of ingredients Each of which as,801.48,3.96,803.46
we know accomplishes certain beneficial,803.459,4.861,805.8895
results well well it depends upon which,805.44,4.86,807.87
combination of those ingredients we use,808.32,4.1,810.37
and the proportions in which we use them,810.3,4.44,812.52
mathematically we may never find the,812.42,3.82,814.3299999999999
right combination or the exact,814.74,3.24,816.36
proportions to produce the effect you're,816.24,4.08,818.28
talking about it will be a miracle but,817.98,4.799,820.3795
you can do it my boy,820.32,5.1,822.87
I told you I didn't want any calls Mr,822.779,4.5,825.029
Oxley Dr Newton's on the phone I told,825.42,3.24,827.04
him you were busy but he said it's very,827.279,3.661,829.1095
important who is he well he's done he's,828.66,4.5,830.91

oh Mr Oxford can I try again no it's,837.0,3.899,838.9495
very important,839.7,5.96,842.6800000000001
find someone to type it for you yes sir,840.899,4.761,843.2795
anybody can type,849.6,3.14,851.1700000000001
what would you say was calling Dr Lenten,853.92,5.039,856.4395

broke loose we've got to hurry he's,881.94,4.62,884.25
acting very strangely obviously a,884.399,4.081,886.4395
reaction to your formula I knew you,886.56,5.07,889.0949999999999
could do it Barnaby I knew it,888.48,5.7,891.33
oh I know that he's opened the door of,900.5,3.699,902.3495
his cage he has been acting very strange,902.639,3.06,904.169

I'd like to consult with Dr Fulton alone,1002.72,6.539,1005.9895
will have the same effect in humans it's,1006.579,4.961,1009.0595
the greatest thing in modern science,1009.259,4.14,1011.3290000000001
we intend to discontinue every other,1011.54,3.359,1013.2194999999999
product in the plant we'll turn out,1013.399,3.661,1015.2295
before and nothing but before I'd like,1014.899,4.081,1016.9395
to offer myself a sufficed human to try,1017.06,4.32,1019.2199999999999
it Mr oxy that may be dangerous I'm,1018.98,5.28,1021.62
perfectly willing to take that chance,1021.38,7.439,1025.0995
oh this isn't brood off what but no no,1024.26,6.659,1027.5895
no this this chimpanzee is only six,1028.819,4.98,1031.309
months old Rudolph is a male this is a,1030.919,4.741,1033.2895
female how do they are you sure or,1033.799,3.721,1035.6595
reasonably she's wearing Rudolph's,1035.66,4.019,1037.6695
jacket but this is Esther here hold on,1037.52,3.539,1039.2895
to Esther will you please look how prove,1039.679,3.721,1041.5395
it to you now there's Rudolph with,1041.059,3.961,1043.0394999999999
Esther's number on well I suppose a,1043.4,3.299,1045.0495
janitor gave them a bet in Swiss jackets,1045.02,4.279,1047.1595
by mistake,1046.699,2.6,1047.999
I'm glad it happened no you're expecting,1051.82,5.14,1054.3899999999999
too much from that formula,1055.039,4.5,1057.289
before Mr Oxley perhaps his name is,1056.96,4.8,1059.3600000000001
confusing you okay just let me work in,1059.539,3.661,1061.3695
an avatars for a couple of hours I'll be,1061.76,2.76,1063.14
better able to prove what the formula,1063.2,3.18,1064.79
will do let me know when you're ready,1064.52,3.779,1066.4095
and let's have no more of these false,1066.38,3.96,1068.3600000000001
alarms they've certainly taken out of a,1068.299,5.521,1071.0595
man come along Miss Laurel,1070.34,5.16,1072.9199999999998
it's kind of ridiculous way to start a,1073.82,2.4,1075.02
I hope it doesn't get any worse,1076.22,3.5,1077.97
sodium excavate,1084.32,3.5,1086.07
three thousand milligrams that's okay,1090.62,7.34,1094.29
you keep quiet,1094.94,3.02,1096.45
honestly don't you like the way I'm,1124.059,4.021,1126.0695
doing this,1125.78,2.3,1126.93
sodium and update yeah,1144.74,3.2,1146.34
three dose should be 1200 milligrams,1148.12,4.14,1150.1899999999998
did you bathe the monkeys this morning,1182.679,4.12,1184.739
oh yes of course sure well then you,1184.94,4.32,1187.1000000000001
mixed up the uniforms oh I did oh I'm,1186.799,4.201,1188.8995
off for sure enough I'll fix them up,1189.26,2.94,1190.73
right away no that's all right you can,1191.0,2.039,1192.0195
do it when you feed them this afternoon,1192.2,2.339,1193.3695
that'll be soon enough but don't let it,1193.039,4.221,1195.1495
happen again oh no sir,1194.539,5.401,1197.2395
oh quiet down you've caused me enough,1197.26,4.68,1199.6
trouble already,1199.94,5.46,1202.67
grown-up means pain with monkey,1201.94,7.8,1205.8400000000001
my rabbit guinea pigs,1205.4,4.34,1207.5700000000002
what's the matter oh oh my bursitis well,1289.12,6.1,1292.1699999999998
that's one of the things I hope the,1293.96,3.36,1295.64
formula will alleviate if you tend to,1295.22,4.14,1297.29
take it yourself certainly I'd uh,1297.32,3.96,1299.3
finally tried on Jerome well I wouldn't,1299.36,3.12,1300.9199999999998
dare try it on Jerome do you remember,1301.28,2.94,1302.75
what happened with the hairy starter yes,1302.48,3.9,1304.43
one of our more successful experiments,1304.22,4.26,1306.3500000000001
now we learned how to remove hair anyway,1306.38,5.779,1309.2695
let's talk about something else,1308.48,3.679,1310.3195
guys I thought you were going to attend,1399.5,4.86,1401.93
to that later oh how do I even changing,1401.659,5.041,1404.1795000000002
them Doctor Esther got out not putting,1404.36,4.199,1406.4595
her back in the cage oh well I guess it,1406.7,3.3,1408.3500000000001
was my fault I forgot to close the lock,1408.559,3.901,1410.5095
and I missed your stuff up there I'll,1410.0,5.84,1412.92
take care of it Guster all right,1412.46,3.38,1414.15
oh don't bother with anything now Jerome,1417.44,4.38,1419.63
I'm anxious to try this,1419.539,4.14,1421.609
seriously doctor you think you should,1421.82,4.32,1423.98
take it self-experimentation is against,1423.679,5.101,1426.2295000000001
the rules of all good research the,1426.14,4.44,1428.3600000000001
history of discovery of the history of,1428.78,4.56,1431.06
people who didn't follow rule,1430.58,6.06,1433.61
here it goes to x five eight and a,1433.34,5.719,1436.1995
better world,1436.64,2.419,1437.8495
get some water,1444.28,3.36,1445.96
all that Gus,1448.22,5.019,1450.7295
already makes the water taste bitter,1457.4,3.86,1459.3300000000002
well better put these away theoretically,1463.58,4.38,1465.77
doctor what might be the first reaction,1466.22,4.079,1468.2595000000001
oh and the biggest idea what about the,1467.96,3.9,1469.91
lane of time it might depends upon the,1470.299,3.061,1471.8295
period of assault channel it's quite,1471.86,3.74,1473.7299999999998
Touch of dizziness and you have a slight,1475.6,4.84,1478.02
Flash oh well that's probably due to my,1478.46,4.76,1480.8400000000001
natural excitement,1480.44,2.78,1481.8300000000002
around 150. well that's eleven there's,1483.58,4.24,1485.6999999999998
nothing in the mixture that could,1486.86,3.12,1488.4199999999998
accelerate the heart and you feel dizzy,1487.82,3.78,1489.71
as a matter of fact I believe it's,1491.6,3.72,1493.4599999999998
increasing well I better record my,1492.74,2.98,1494.23
pulse 150 is that right 150.,1500.299,6.961,1503.7794999999999
mounting vertigo,1504.32,4.25,1506.445
no no yeah,1507.26,2.76,1508.64
and sensation,1510.02,6.18,1513.11
not unlike a series of small electric,1511.82,6.78,1515.21
Jerome Jerome where are you I'm here,1524.72,5.459,1527.4495
what is it I can't see I'm blind please,1526.7,4.8,1529.1000000000001
go on with the notes oh this is too,1530.179,2.521,1531.4395000000002
serious I'll get something here as I,1531.5,2.52,1532.76
tell you there isn't time I know what I,1532.7,2.64,1534.02
took if they ended up we'll have to find,1534.02,5.58,1536.81
it ourselves uh just take the notes,1535.34,4.74,1537.7099999999998
a general milkiness but no discomfort in,1542.9,5.46,1545.63
fact uh it's a sensation of extreme,1545.72,6.079,1548.7595000000001
well-being as if I,1548.36,3.439,1550.0794999999998
what is it paralysis can you speak try,1552.799,6.781,1556.1895
typing one for yes two for no,1557.0,6.59,1560.295
can you hear me doctor can you hear me,1559.58,6.479,1562.8194999999998
whose number that you want let me have,1566.059,2.941,1567.5294999999999

60945 this isn't possible,1580.659,6.461,1583.8895
it is possible Jerome for the first time,1584.72,4.8,1587.1200000000001
in 10 years I am able to see without my,1587.12,4.14,1589.1899999999998
glasses perfect vision I can't believe,1589.52,3.899,1591.4695
now I can see again doctor x58 seems to,1595.88,5.76,1598.7600000000002
be a success oh indeed it does,1599.0,5.48,1601.74

happened to the man he took some of the,1716.179,3.541,1717.9495000000002
formula and went out of here acting,1717.86,4.02,1719.87
almost as though no exactly as though we,1719.72,4.98,1722.21

what kind uh you'll see it soon enough,2216.28,4.62,2218.59
no darling you were a real idiot to try,2218.339,4.121,2220.3995
the formula on yourself something could,2220.9,3.24,2222.52
have happened oh it did I mean something,2222.46,3.899,2224.4095
serious here have some coffee yeah thank,2224.14,5.04,2226.66
you oh oh I stand every muscle in my,2226.359,5.581,2229.1495
body roller skating good Heavens don't,2229.18,4.38,2231.37
tell me what roller skating yeah afraid,2231.94,2.94,2233.41
this is breaking out with red blood,2234.88,6.6,2238.1800000000003
no blotches deer that's lipstick oh,2237.46,6.18,2240.55
yeah Edwina what I have to tell you is,2241.48,4.8,2243.88
unbelievable yes it is unbelievable on,2243.64,4.8,2246.04
roller skates hmm what balance well I,2246.28,3.86,2248.21
was known roller skates all afternoon,2248.44,4.44,2250.66
obviously no you never believe what I,2250.14,5.14,2252.71
did I broke records huh oh you'd have,2252.88,3.36,2254.56
been amazed I wish you could have been,2255.28,4.14,2257.3500000000004
there well I wish I had been too well I,2256.24,5.16,2258.8199999999997
did things I never dreamed I'd do you,2259.42,5.88,2262.36
know I try the Swan Dive I missed,2261.4,7.199,2264.9995
well no wonder you're worn out finally,2265.3,5.16,2267.88
all of this is very confusing what about,2268.599,3.841,2270.5195000000003
the formula that's what I was telling,2270.46,3.06,2271.9900000000002
oh I'll start at the beginning,2274.72,6.0,2277.72
at 11 52 this morning I took a dose of,2277.9,4.86,2280.33
the formula and in a few minutes I began,2280.72,3.96,2282.7
to behave exactly like a college boy,2282.76,4.68,2285.1000000000004
with 20 20 vision and no birth cyclists,2284.68,5.159,2287.2594999999997
and plenty of lipstick uh well the,2287.44,3.96,2289.42
formula had nothing to do with that I'll,2289.839,3.541,2291.6095
get to that later,2291.4,3.48,2293.14
we've discovered something that the,2294.88,3.12,2296.44
human race has been searching for since,2296.68,3.659,2298.5094999999997
the beginning of time are you really,2298.0,4.44,2300.22
serious born a bit it works well did I,2300.339,2.881,2301.7795
because I can't explain the reactions it,2303.22,3.899,2305.1695
seems to work on the mind,2305.26,4.859,2307.6895000000004
and winner imagine people never aging oh,2307.119,5.46,2309.849
it sounds frightening you mean it it,2310.119,4.98,2312.609
really does that well,2312.579,4.02,2314.5890000000004
because I don't know half of what I'm,2315.099,3.961,2317.0795000000003
gonna do the dose I took is already worn,2316.599,5.581,2319.3895
off I've never seen that was eight hours,2319.06,5.76,2321.94
uh probably the dose was wrong,2322.18,5.52,2324.94
obviously hey where you going oh I'm,2324.82,4.44,2327.04
going to try the experiment again but,2327.7,4.82,2330.1099999999997
this time with a larger dose,2329.26,3.26,2330.8900000000003
must you make another test oh probably,2344.26,4.56,2346.5400000000004
several I'm glad you're here to see if,2346.78,3.6,2348.5800000000004
nothing goes wrong this time,2348.82,3.42,2350.53
I want you to observe and make notes of,2350.38,4.199,2352.4795
everything I do knowing me so well,2352.24,3.9,2354.1899999999996
you'll be able to interpret the exact,2354.579,4.52,2356.8390000000004
meaning of my behavior,2356.14,5.219,2358.7495
don't you think you want to change that,2359.099,4.721,2361.4595
code and wipe that stuff off your face,2361.359,4.441,2363.5795
before you try it again oh yes perhaps,2363.82,3.72,2365.6800000000003
you're right by the way whose lipstick,2365.8,4.08,2367.84
is it uh what's your name you know oxy,2367.54,3.44,2369.2599999999998
Oh you mean that little pin-up girl,2370.98,7.0,2374.48
cute sort of but half infant,2374.56,6.48,2377.7999999999997
not perhaps it's visible well she's not,2377.98,4.859,2380.4095
Barnaby how much of this stuff you're,2382.839,3.661,2384.6695
going to take well that's what I thought,2384.82,3.539,2386.5895
out there I've increased the dose,2386.5,4.2,2388.6
seeing that way I'll be,2388.359,4.141,2390.4294999999997
Edwina what are you doing,2390.7,3.96,2392.68
what did you do that for,2392.5,4.28,2394.64
get your notebook I've done it do it,2401.16,4.36,2403.3399999999997
yourself a bit of get me some water oh,2404.32,3.06,2405.8500000000004
no really Edwina For Heaven's Sake,2405.52,3.599,2407.3195
besides according to your story you were,2407.38,4.92,2409.84
exactly 100 scientist after you took it,2409.119,4.921,2411.5795000000003
other things became much more,2412.3,4.38,2414.4900000000002
interesting perhaps you're right,2414.04,6.299,2417.1895
oh even the water tastes bitter I did to,2416.68,5.96,2419.66
Barnaby I'm a little bit frightened I'm,2426.579,5.341,2429.2495000000004
here dude it's kind of chilly isn't it,2429.7,5.12,2432.2599999999998
I'll take care of you,2431.92,2.9,2433.37
I don't feel anything,2434.98,3.96,2436.96
is it supposed to work right away just a,2436.66,4.62,2438.97
few moments,2438.94,4.5,2441.19
would you clean off your face,2441.28,3.72,2443.1400000000003
because if I get 10 years younger and,2443.44,3.36,2445.12
see that lipstick,2445.0,4.14,2447.07
and I will knock somebody's block off oh,2446.8,3.96,2448.78
economy is it true about before I just,2450.76,4.26,2452.8900000000003
heard the most fantastic things about,2453.7,3.36,2455.3799999999997
you does it work you'll have a chance to,2455.02,3.96,2457.0
judge for yourself quite soon Mr oxney,2457.06,4.5,2459.31
my wife just took 50 cc's of the formula,2458.98,6.0,2461.98
really by charge by charge Dr Bruno and,2461.56,4.799,2463.9595
Miss Laurel are on their way leave work,2464.98,3.359,2466.6595
there to come in here immediately well,2466.359,4.081,2468.3995
Mrs Fulton it's very kind of you to land,2468.339,4.201,2470.4395
yourself to this experiment thank you,2470.44,4.76,2472.82
Miss doxley,2472.54,2.66,2473.87
well we have to watch your reactions,2481.78,3.96,2483.76
yes I suppose so,2485.74,3.56,2487.52
now I know how a poor little guinea pig,2489.7,4.7,2492.0499999999997
may I sit down Yes dear,2499.78,4.52,2502.0400000000004
stand there do something,2505.119,5.301,2507.7695000000003
also around 150. that's the same as my,2517.32,5.22,2519.9300000000003
there doesn't seem to be any fever,2523.18,3.36,2524.8599999999997
outside of being somewhat embarrassed I,2524.619,4.321,2526.7795
feel exceedingly well what reaction do,2526.54,5.16,2529.12
you expect Barnaby well I don't know I,2528.94,4.08,2530.98
suppose it depends upon the individual,2531.7,3.36,2533.3799999999997
with you it took the form of thinking as,2533.02,4.2,2535.12
though you were 20. oh that's true keep,2535.06,4.559,2537.3395
studying right now what was Mrs Fulton,2537.22,5.46,2539.95
like at that age huh,2539.619,5.641,2542.4395
well Edwina was a very serious minded,2542.68,3.36,2544.3599999999997
she majored in economics and took,2546.04,3.9,2547.99
several summer courses in ichthyology,2548.26,4.5,2550.51
and cooking at theology the study of,2549.94,5.28,2552.58
fish Jerome said your first symptoms was,2552.76,4.98,2555.25
your eyes your vision became perfect oh,2555.22,4.32,2557.3799999999997
that's true Mr but you can't count upon,2557.74,3.48,2559.4799999999996
that is To See edwina's Vision is,2559.54,3.48,2561.2799999999997
already perfect it will probably take an,2561.22,4.32,2563.3799999999997
entirely different form my dear do you,2563.02,4.38,2565.21
feel anything strange,2565.54,5.039,2568.0595
not a thing how about you Mr Oxley oh,2567.4,5.52,2570.1600000000003
but I haven't taken anything oh yes you,2570.579,3.601,2572.3795
have Miss Jackson,2572.92,3.36,2574.6
you hear that part of me a rather odd,2574.18,4.08,2576.22
reaction undoubtedly we can expect,2576.28,4.559,2578.5595000000003
something soon we certainly can she's,2578.26,4.68,2580.6000000000004
sitting very still is impossible there's,2580.839,3.961,2582.8195
not enough movement well if there isn't,2582.94,4.139,2585.0095
there soon will be I can hardly wait for,2584.8,5.72,2587.6600000000003
the results this is quite a moment,2587.079,5.76,2589.9590000000003
that's it Oxley watch him want to be,2590.52,3.64,2592.34
watching it's working it's working it's,2592.839,2.76,2594.219
working you hear what you said bye to me,2594.16,3.54,2595.93
it's taking effect something wrong about,2595.599,4.081,2597.6395

and you angry at me because of what I,3654.599,5.401,3657.2995
did last night did we know I thought,3657.42,4.02,3659.4300000000003
this over very carefully and I've almost,3660.0,3.119,3661.5595
come to a conclusion,3661.44,3.98,3663.43
I'm thinking of destroying the formula,3663.119,5.46,3665.849
destroying it so then you are angry yeah,3665.42,4.96,3667.9
I've been in better moods,3668.579,3.301,3670.2295000000004
you think you'd feel any better if I,3670.38,3.36,3672.06
fixed you some toast and coffee you,3671.88,3.0,3673.38
haven't had any breakfast yet remember,3673.74,3.359,3675.4195
yeah thank you I'm starved how are they,3674.88,4.08,3676.92
coffee and coffee butter in there you,3677.099,3.601,3678.8995
can use this plug as your own music all,3678.96,2.82,3680.37
you know I've decided that the formula,3681.78,3.9,3683.73
is the most dubious Discovery since,3684.059,3.721,3685.9195
itching powder and just about as useful,3685.68,4.56,3687.96
oh I wouldn't say that it showed your,3687.78,4.74,3690.15
bursitis and improved your vision I must,3690.24,5.16,3692.8199999999997
say it made you feel young,3692.52,4.62,3694.83
I'm beginning to wonder if being young,3695.4,3.719,3697.2595
is all is cracked up to be,3697.14,4.74,3699.5099999999998
and dream of use we remember it as a,3699.119,4.74,3701.489
time of Nightingales and Valentines at,3701.88,4.5,3704.13
one of the facts not adjustment near,3703.859,4.44,3706.0789999999997
idiocy in a series of low comedy,3706.38,4.02,3708.3900000000003
disasters that's what youth is I don't,3708.299,5.421,3711.0095
see how anyone survives it,3710.4,3.32,3712.06
and tell me something because he's been,3714.079,5.74,3716.949
bothering me why did you want a divorce,3716.16,6.659,3719.4894999999997
oh Barnaby it wasn't me it was the,3719.819,4.8,3722.219
formula you ought to understand that oh,3722.819,3.121,3724.3795
I understand it was a formula that,3724.619,3.861,3726.5495
brought it out,3725.94,4.379,3728.1295
brush whatever,3728.48,5.319,3731.1395
some subconscious aversion to me,3730.319,5.701,3733.1695
a virgin to you,3733.799,5.641,3736.6195
I love you you Potato Head,3736.02,5.4,3738.72
oh I know there isn't some buried,3739.44,3.419,3741.1495
resentment that you don't consciously,3741.42,3.899,3743.3695000000002
realize well I certainly don't,3742.859,4.381,3745.0495
consciously realize it and I think,3745.319,4.161,3747.3995
that's pretty,3747.24,2.24,3748.3599999999997
right a minute what about the way you,3750.059,4.321,3752.2195
kept bringing up Hank and twister,3751.44,4.34,3753.61
do you love him,3754.38,4.199,3756.4795
now that is ridiculous I don't know you,3755.78,4.6,3758.0800000000004
kissed him didn't you you can't seem to,3758.579,3.78,3760.469
get that out of your mind can you no I,3760.38,4.38,3762.57
can't well all right are you in love,3762.359,5.161,3764.9395

well you went smooching with her on,3767.52,4.44,3769.74
roller skates and may I ask what was,3769.859,4.141,3771.9294999999997
your hidden aversion or subconscious,3771.96,3.54,3773.73
discontent or whatever it is you want to,3774.0,3.54,3775.77
call it that made you go playing patty,3775.5,4.799,3777.8995
cake with her all over town doing a Swan,3777.54,5.64,3780.36
Dive acting like a,3780.299,5.841,3783.2195
I'll finally,3786.42,3.78,3788.31
don't say anything darling I would,3788.46,3.899,3790.4095
we should be fighting,3792.359,4.921,3794.8195
we're having doubts about our marriage,3795.0,4.38,3797.19
that isn't right that's just my point,3797.28,4.019,3799.2895000000003
that's why I'm going to destroy the,3799.38,4.4,3801.58
oh no really are you crying,3806.22,3.74,3808.0899999999997
are you sure you want to throw away two,3813.9,5.04,3816.42
years of hard work yes I am but still in,3815.7,4.919,3818.1594999999998
my head unfortunately,3818.94,3.24,3820.56
I'm going to forget it it's too,3820.619,5.121,3823.1795
dangerous it's utterly unpredictable,3822.18,3.56,3823.96

want to point out that Fulton made his,3988.5,3.119,3990.0595
discovery on our time I've got bad news,3989.7,4.98,3992.1899999999996

what last night Dr lintel Dr Lantern Dr,3994.68,6.179,3997.7695
Lantern Dr Fulton's assistant brought me,3998.46,4.8,4000.86
a dose of the formula and I took it I,4000.859,3.901,4002.8095
can't tell you with what eagerness I,4003.26,4.68,4005.6000000000004
waited the results but they were not no,4004.76,5.52,4007.5200000000004
reactions at all the formula that Dr,4007.94,4.98,4010.43
thingamabad brought me is incomplete now,4010.28,4.259,4012.4095
there must be another ingredient that he,4012.92,3.78,4014.81
knows nothing about Dr Fulton has made,4014.539,3.841,4016.4595000000004
no record of it and there's nothing in,4016.7,3.72,4018.56
his notes to tell us what it is and,4018.38,5.479,4021.1195000000002

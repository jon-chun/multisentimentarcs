Ellie hurry up we've only got five,77.0,5.46,79.73
minutes I'll be right down,79.08,3.38,80.77
I'd like to say a few words about what's,100.86,4.14,102.92999999999999
happened to me over the past year,102.78,4.199,104.87950000000001
your women may not symbolize you think,105.0,3.299,106.6495
men have it easy but that's why you're,106.979,2.761,108.3595
man is a very delicate and sensitive,109.74,4.68,112.08
mechanism if you treat him right you're,112.38,3.48,114.11999999999999
flatter him and butter him up a little,114.42,3.659,116.2495
bit he's good for years,115.86,5.28,118.5
but if somebody rocks the boat,118.079,5.281,120.7195
you know how it is man,123.36,4.14,125.42999999999999
you work hard for years trying to build,125.52,3.78,127.41
a home raise a family,127.5,4.739,129.8695
and then comes one wonderful day when,129.3,4.62,131.61
for the first time in your life you feel,132.239,2.941,133.7095
you're a little ahead of the game things,133.92,3.42,135.63
have eased up at the office the kids are,135.18,4.68,137.52
all set married or well along in school,137.34,3.84,139.26
and you're raring to go,141.18,4.32,143.34
you think of all the wonderful things,143.52,3.48,145.26000000000002
you would have done in your life you,145.5,4.28,147.64
just had time,147.0,2.78,148.39
if you go fishing,150.06,4.38,152.25
to go big game hunting you might even,152.16,4.2,154.26
climb Mount Everest,154.44,4.68,156.78
anyway you're on top of the world you,156.36,4.379,158.54950000000002
begin to feel you're a combination of,159.12,4.82,161.53
Don Juan and Columbus,160.739,3.201,162.33950000000002
and that's just the moment they choose,164.4,4.94,166.87
to let you have it,166.5,2.84,167.92

May when everything seems to come to,186.42,5.459,189.1495

just waiting for me to give it the nod,724.2,4.079,726.2395
and now a grandfather,725.82,4.5,728.07
I thought of the other grandfathers I,728.279,2.881,729.7195
why they were old old men the toothless,731.16,5.58,733.9499999999999
old codger down the street,734.279,4.441,736.4995
a client of ours his only fun was,736.74,4.58,739.03
cutting people out of his will,738.72,4.799,741.1195
those ancient daughters at the club,741.32,4.42,743.5300000000001

that evening I felt like a million,796.68,3.92,798.64
but the next morning I fell closer to a,800.639,4.461,802.8695
Andy Buckley's here for your golf match,815.18,5.64,818.0
what's the matter I'm gonna get done,817.399,6.24,820.519
where's the pain it's all over oh,823.639,4.781,826.0295
whatever did you do what happened I'll,826.44,3.12,828.0
call Dr Barnes and get him over here,828.42,4.52,830.68
right oh I don't want any doctor,829.56,3.38,831.25
Buckley if I don't want a doctor I,837.44,5.56,840.22
certainly don't want Buckley so we might,840.18,5.099,842.7294999999999
be able to help help don't you think,843.0,4.5,845.25
he's done enough all I want is a hot,845.279,5.961,848.2595
bath with some Epsom salts,847.5,3.74,849.37
the next week Ellie gave what she called,857.839,4.06,859.869
a stork shower,860.279,4.081,862.3195
this is one form of highway robbery not,861.899,5.421,864.6095
punishable by law,864.36,2.96,865.84
understanding how wonderful that you got,880.32,3.0,881.82
home and done you should see the things,882.0,3.54,883.77
they gave K everyone was so sweet they,883.32,4.56,885.6
all brought us something what else could,885.54,4.68,887.88
they do honey oh Stan you make it sound,887.88,4.86,890.31
so sordid go on in Casey oh no no no I,890.22,4.799,892.6195
had no place for a man,892.74,4.62,895.05
where are you going I don't want to come,895.019,4.26,897.149
in and see my plunder well I'll see you,897.36,3.24,898.98
later oh come on Stanley when you,899.279,2.641,900.5995
finished I have something very important,900.6,2.7,901.95
I want to talk over with you I'll be in,901.92,3.56,903.6999999999999
the kitchen,903.3,2.18,904.39
Buckley looked like a man going down for,925.019,4.32,927.179
the third and last time,927.06,4.5,929.31
but I decided to let him stew in his own,929.339,4.461,931.5695000000001
what do you want mom,937.82,5.68,940.6600000000001
I wanted to talk to you before the,943.5,4.92,945.96
dunstons got here well you know how,945.899,4.081,947.9395
worried I've been about how we're gonna,948.42,3.719,950.2795
rattle around in this house after Ben,949.98,4.14,952.0500000000001
leaves the school in the fall,952.139,4.681,954.4795
mm-hmm well I had a wonderful idea today,954.12,4.62,956.43
I say we asked hey and Buckley to move,958.74,4.14,960.8100000000001
in with us,961.56,3.54,963.3299999999999
Ellie are you crazy,962.88,4.56,965.16
the Stanley would be so simple,965.1,4.5,967.35
we could make a sitting room for them,967.44,4.68,969.7800000000001
out of Kay's old bedroom and knock,969.6,4.32,971.76
through a door to Ben's room and that,972.12,3.959,974.0995
could be their bedroom then if we put,973.92,4.38,976.11
Tommy in the spare room,976.079,4.141,978.1495
we could put connecting doors from the,978.3,4.5,980.55
bathroom and that would be the nursery,980.22,4.5,982.47
right next to our room we could even,982.8,3.659,984.6295
knock through a door to our room so if a,984.72,4.08,986.76
baby cried yes that'd be good Noah Ellie,986.459,5.761,989.3394999999999
no no damn it won't cost much I had the,988.8,5.76,991.68
contractor over here today it's a,992.22,3.9,994.1700000000001
perfect place for the baby and the,994.56,3.42,996.27
wonderful thing would be that if they,996.12,3.779,998.0095
wanted to go out some evening or even go,997.98,3.24,999.6
away for a week or two they wouldn't,999.899,2.94,1001.369
have to worry we'd be right here to take,1001.22,4.44,1003.44
you yeah yeah I love Kelly I know how,1002.839,4.74,1005.2090000000001
anxious you've been to get your hopes,1005.66,4.32,1007.8199999999999
into that baby but the answer is no I've,1007.579,4.021,1009.5894999999999
been all through that you know the two,1009.98,3.359,1011.6595
o'clock feedings and the colic and the,1011.6,3.299,1013.2495
measles and all the rest of it and I'm,1013.339,2.881,1014.7795000000001
not going through it again especially,1014.899,3.36,1016.579
with somebody else's baby but it,1016.22,3.78,1018.11
wouldn't be like that Stan it would be,1018.259,3.601,1020.0595000000001
fun to have a baby yeah you can go over,1020.0,3.48,1021.74
and see the baby at their apartment when,1021.86,3.24,1023.48
they get it all washed and ironed but,1023.48,3.18,1025.07
it's not coming here and that's final,1025.1,3.239,1026.7195
well you know that apartment isn't big,1026.66,3.12,1028.22
enough right tell them to buy a house,1028.339,3.36,1030.019
they can't afford a house oh they should,1029.78,4.2,1031.8799999999999
have thought of that before,1031.699,4.561,1033.9795000000001
I don't understand how you can be so,1033.98,6.859,1037.4095
hard on a poor innocent little baby,1036.26,4.579,1038.5495

mother for over a year and then suddenly,1367.46,3.3,1369.1100000000001
you came along to the spotlight you must,1368.6,4.86,1371.03
have hated me no no I don't think it was,1370.76,4.32,1372.92

then we must have gone into your room a,1383.539,3.541,1385.3095
dozen times the next hour to see how you,1385.34,3.6,1387.1399999999999

wanted to see if we were dead and if you,1388.94,2.58,1390.23
cried we went in to see what was wrong,1390.32,2.88,1391.76
I remember lying awake that night,1393.2,2.88,1394.64
thinking to myself now what have we got,1394.7,3.359,1396.3795
into here we were two perfectly happy,1396.08,5.04,1398.6
people three is the air now we're,1398.059,4.62,1400.369
trapped by 20 inches of screaming,1402.679,4.801,1405.0795
Humanity do all fathers feel that way,1404.84,4.92,1407.3

grabbed it with such a grip,1425.059,6.421,1428.2694999999999
from that moment on you had me hooked,1428.36,5.6,1431.1599999999999

one thing wrong,1483.86,5.28,1486.5
haven't done a thing about the nursery I,1486.44,4.68,1488.78
could cry about it what's the matter,1489.14,4.56,1491.42
Herbert's doing it Dunstan,1491.12,4.14,1493.1899999999998
he was so upset about they're not moving,1493.7,2.82,1495.1100000000001
in with him he said the least they could,1495.26,2.46,1496.49
do would be to let them furnish the,1496.52,2.58,1497.81
nursery he's going to give them a crib,1497.72,3.42,1499.43
and a bassinet and a screen and a chest,1499.1,3.66,1500.9299999999998
of drawers will probably all be done in,1501.14,4.94,1503.6100000000001
14 karat gold,1502.76,3.32,1504.42
what are we gonna give the baby,1506.12,3.72,1507.9799999999998
what are you so surprised about did you,1509.84,2.699,1511.1895
think I was gonna give the baby in,1511.64,2.519,1512.8995
prison oh as a matter of fact there was,1512.539,2.88,1513.979
something I was looking at today that,1514.159,2.821,1515.5695
would make a wonderful present to put it,1515.419,2.88,1516.8590000000002
right in this window and it keeps the,1516.98,3.24,1518.6
air clean and the right temperature it's,1518.299,3.481,1520.0395
very pretty and modern looking it's,1520.22,3.48,1521.96
quite expensive what's the name of it I,1521.78,3.42,1523.49
don't know the name of it but it will,1523.7,4.44,1525.92
all extend this way downtown,1525.2,5.66,1528.03
you see uh you're regulated from here,1528.14,4.62,1530.45
controls the air and the temperature at,1530.86,3.46,1532.59
all times see,1532.76,5.159,1535.3395
no dust no soap no pollen Wonder Ellie's,1534.32,5.04,1536.84
idea I wish we'd had one for Tommy,1537.919,2.76,1539.2990000000002
probably wouldn't have those adenoids,1539.36,3.66,1541.1899999999998
and it is wonderful and look over here,1540.679,5.581,1543.4695000000002
today I want to show you this crazy you,1543.02,5.519,1545.7794999999999
turn it on and leave it here beside his,1546.26,4.14,1548.33
crib and then you can go out and close,1548.539,4.441,1550.7595
the door and if he cries or even if,1550.4,4.379,1552.5895
there's any change in his breathing you,1552.98,3.12,1554.54
can hear it from anywhere in the house,1554.779,3.241,1556.3995
no well they're certainly going to love,1556.1,3.959,1558.0794999999998
that and here's his combination bath and,1558.02,4.5,1560.27
dressing table right just the right size,1560.059,4.441,1562.2794999999999
what is that what does that mean oh,1562.52,3.24,1564.1399999999999
that's mine I thought he might as well,1564.5,2.46,1565.73
get used to it he'll be going there,1565.76,3.659,1567.5895
someday oh he will oh yes as a matter of,1566.96,4.02,1568.97
fact I've already registered him in the,1569.419,4.681,1571.7595000000001
class of 1973. I'm a Dartmouth man,1570.98,5.1,1573.53
myself oh that's a good college too now,1574.1,3.6,1575.8999999999999
this bad stand I want you to notice the,1576.08,4.339,1578.2495
height of it a good college,1577.7,5.52,1580.46

1949 and we shall probably and we have,1588.22,5.199,1590.8195
defeated you five years running in,1591.559,4.261,1593.6895
hockey and our bobsled team is probably,1593.419,4.021,1595.4295000000002
the finest that has ever been developed,1595.82,3.859,1597.7495
in the history,1597.44,5.219,1600.0495
uh good that's one of the funniest,1599.679,6.341,1602.8495
reminds you've ever made tomorrow now,1602.659,6.62,1605.969
listen here and you know,1606.02,3.259,1607.6495
what do you think is a nursery isn't it,1609.46,5.8,1612.3600000000001
lovely the wonderful thing is most of,1612.44,5.219,1615.0495
you can grow up with him the shelves for,1615.26,5.1,1617.81
instance it'll hold his toys now but,1617.659,4.201,1619.7595000000001
later he can use it for his tennis,1620.36,2.72,1621.7199999999998
they had taken over the Baby Lock Stock,1623.08,5.099,1625.6295
and Barrel,1625.76,2.419,1626.9695
oh thank you this isn't that a beautiful,1629.26,5.919,1632.2195
racquet box mother Dustin gave to me she,1632.12,5.039,1634.6395
gave me the whole album I remember that,1635.179,3.48,1636.919
I used to listen to classical music,1637.159,3.781,1639.0495
while I was waiting for bloodlift I,1638.659,3.981,1640.6495000000002
think that's why he whistles so well,1640.94,4.619,1643.2495000000001
have you ever heard him with whistle,1642.64,6.1,1645.69
no no I haven't but you should ask him,1645.559,6.421,1648.7694999999999
sometime yes I will I certainly will by,1648.74,4.62,1651.05
the way son what are you gonna call this,1651.98,3.0,1653.48
baby of yours we've had some terrible,1653.36,4.08,1655.3999999999999
arguments we've gone through all the,1654.98,4.5,1657.23
telephone books the dictionaries the,1657.44,3.839,1659.3595
baby books Barney we found a couple of,1659.48,4.559,1661.7595000000001
names we both liked come on sit down sit,1661.279,3.721,1663.1395
uh if it's a boy we thought we might,1665.0,4.62,1667.31
call him Andrew Andrew who's Andrew well,1667.039,4.861,1669.4695
there's Andrew Jackson and Andrew,1669.62,4.5,1671.87
Nordell and besides we like the name,1671.9,3.139,1673.4695000000002
and we both like the name Jonathan,1675.039,4.5,1677.289
well we also thought we might call him,1679.96,5.38,1682.65
Michael that's a good name God call him,1682.82,4.02,1684.83
Michael I went to school with a Michael,1685.34,4.38,1687.53
and he smelled well now Ellie just,1686.84,4.86,1689.27
because you're Michael smelt you know it,1689.72,3.66,1691.55
doesn't mean that all Michael's have to,1691.7,2.76,1693.0800000000002
you know a name that I've Loved ever,1694.46,3.98,1696.45
since I've first read Little Women,1696.5,5.039,1699.0195
Lauren Laurie remember how dear he was,1698.44,4.599,1700.7395000000001
how about Timothy I think that has,1701.539,2.52,1702.799
everything do you like the name of,1703.039,2.161,1704.1195
well I now Ellie they've already told,1705.2,4.979,1707.6895
you they've been all through this why do,1707.779,5.041,1710.2995
we suggest any more names besides the,1710.179,5.1,1712.729
names they have are wonderful Jonathan,1712.82,4.32,1714.98
Michael Andrew they're all wonderful,1715.279,3.9,1717.229
names but you have to think of two names,1717.14,3.84,1719.0600000000002
that go together,1719.179,4.74,1721.549
Andrew Dunstan that doesn't sound very,1720.98,3.74,1722.85
Stanley they haven't made up their minds,1724.72,4.48,1726.96
they need our help if I may interrupt I,1726.98,3.54,1728.75
think you're going about this all wrong,1729.2,4.2,1731.3
my idea would be to use a family name,1730.52,5.639,1733.3395
that's right the first grandson is,1733.4,4.44,1735.6200000000001
always supposed to have the name of the,1736.159,4.081,1738.1995000000002
paternal grandfather no no no no,1737.84,4.26,1739.97
Outdoors that's not what I meant I was,1740.24,4.02,1742.25
thinking of my great grandfather Malcolm,1742.1,5.04,1744.62
oh well say uncle Wilford well we're,1744.26,4.38,1746.45
talking about family names what about,1747.14,3.659,1748.9695000000002
Stanley Stanley Dunston that ought to,1748.64,4.68,1750.98
satisfy everybody well we did think,1750.799,6.961,1754.2794999999999
about that no no no no now you were once,1753.32,6.239,1756.4395
Stanley in the family is enough you're,1757.76,3.659,1759.5895
right how about Cornelius that's a,1759.559,3.541,1761.3295
family name and then let's see there's,1761.419,5.221,1764.0295
Gregory and Dexter and David I had some,1763.1,6.6,1766.3999999999999
wonderful names in my family too Milo,1766.64,6.3,1769.7900000000002
and Pennington Bennington now that's a,1769.7,5.94,1772.67
nice that'd be a nice name,1772.94,5.28,1775.5800000000002
we're all talking about boys names what,1775.64,4.2,1777.74
if it's a girl we've got to decide on a,1778.22,3.36,1779.9
girl's name oh it won't be a girl don't,1779.84,3.6,1781.6399999999999
worry the dancing's always run to boys,1781.58,4.38,1783.77
I'm not worried I wanted to be a girl I,1783.44,5.839,1786.3595
like to where you going darling,1785.96,6.62,1789.27
I'm nothing at the store,1789.279,6.64,1792.599
you do too much okay you must rest more,1792.58,5.02,1795.09
oh I don't agree with you I think some,1795.919,3.24,1797.539
work is good for it I think you should,1797.6,4.34,1799.77
have a maid I'd be perfect,1799.159,5.701,1802.0095000000001
is this young doctor of hers I've always,1801.94,4.599,1804.2395000000001
said she could have gone to our family,1804.86,4.14,1806.9299999999998
we wanted her to go to our doctor too,1806.539,5.76,1809.419
my doctor he's fine he's wonderful he,1809.0,5.94,1811.97
told me not to pay any attention nobody,1812.299,5.421,1815.0095
seems to realize this is my baby mine,1814.94,6.02,1817.95
you seem to think for the way you taught,1817.72,5.26,1820.3500000000001
well I'll have you know this I'm gonna,1820.96,4.6,1823.26
have my baby the way I don't want to,1822.98,14.46,1830.21

what do you mean there well the Johnson,1919.7,3.599,1921.4995000000001

him faith in him no one has a right to,1930.5,5.22,1933.11
destroy that confidence thanks pops,1932.419,5.461,1935.1495
it isn't their fault really it's just,1935.72,4.14,1937.79
that well I I guess they just don't,1937.88,3.6,1939.68
understand the new way of looking at,1939.86,2.34,1941.03
well after all as Dr nordale says birth,1942.2,6.839,1945.6195
is a perfectly natural thing a glorious,1945.38,5.82,1948.2900000000002
thing and want to be conscious every,1949.039,4.02,1951.049
minute so so they don't miss a second of,1951.2,4.199,1953.2995
it he believes this woman should be,1953.059,3.781,1954.9495
aware of the wonderful thing that's,1955.399,4.201,1957.4995
happening to her and another thing he,1956.84,3.959,1958.8194999999998
doesn't believe that a woman should be,1959.6,2.699,1960.9495
separated from her baby for one second,1960.799,3.421,1962.5095
after it's born you,1962.299,4.441,1964.5194999999999
you should carry it with you right right,1964.22,4.74,1966.59
back to your room and and keep it there,1966.74,4.679,1969.0795
with you sleeping right there with you,1968.96,5.04,1971.48
in your hospital room that is a little,1971.419,5.161,1973.9995000000001
new isn't it oh pops that's not new,1974.0,5.279,1976.6395
primitive woman has always done it Dr,1976.58,4.62,1978.8899999999999
noidel was in the Pacific and he said,1979.279,4.081,1981.3195
the women there why why they were never,1981.2,4.5,1983.45
separated from their babies they kept,1983.36,3.84,1985.28
them slung on their backs for the first,1985.7,3.599,1987.4995000000001
two years of their lives and he said it,1987.2,4.32,1989.3600000000001
was wonderful for the babies he said if,1989.299,4.321,1991.4595
he had his way all of his mothers would,1991.52,4.98,1994.01
do that you'd you'd carry them on your,1993.62,4.439,1995.8394999999998
back while you were doing your housework,1996.5,3.96,1998.48
and then when he got hungry you'd swing,1998.059,4.921,2000.5194999999999
it around and feed it and then swing it,2000.46,4.68,2002.8
back again he says he gives the baby a,2002.98,5.36,2005.66
wonderful feeling of security,2005.14,3.2,2006.74

anymore in their offense,2065.02,3.72,2066.88
I'm not gonna have my daughter walking,2067.179,3.48,2068.919
around for two years with a papoose on,2068.74,3.3,2070.39
her back calling I tell you that's,2070.659,3.121,2072.2195
figurative he didn't mean that literally,2072.04,5.059,2074.5695
just want to be sure,2073.78,3.319,2075.4395000000004
I'm so glad you came,2084.24,5.08,2086.7799999999997
now I've met the whole family Mr Mrs,2086.679,4.68,2089.0190000000002
Dunstan senior were in this morning they,2089.32,3.72,2091.1800000000003
were they were a little anxious thought,2091.359,3.78,2093.249
Kay was doing too much but I think I,2093.04,3.96,2095.02
convinced them that she was all right,2095.139,3.541,2096.9095
that's a wonderful daughter you have,2097.0,4.26,2099.13
thank you oh excuse me,2098.68,6.2,2101.7799999999997
don't you Mrs Banks thanks,2101.26,3.62,2103.07
what can I do for it,2108.28,3.78,2110.17
well as a matter of fact my wife has,2109.96,4.379,2112.1495
been a little worried too and uh you,2112.06,4.08,2114.1
know our mothers are at this time only,2114.339,3.061,2115.8695
daughter and all that sort of thing and,2116.14,2.459,2117.3695
I thought the best thing to do would be,2117.4,3.24,2119.02
to bring her down here and let her have,2118.599,3.541,2120.3695000000002
a talk with you I think that's very,2120.64,3.18,2122.23
what particularly worries you Mrs Banks,2123.82,5.1,2126.3700000000003
well actually I I well actually it's the,2126.099,6.24,2129.219
whole thing isn't it uh I mean about it,2128.92,6.419,2132.1295
all being so natural and everything,2132.339,4.74,2134.709
I'm just trying to take away any fear,2135.339,3.24,2136.959
she might have,2137.079,3.241,2138.6995
you know the fear of pain can really,2138.579,3.481,2140.3195
produce pain,2140.32,5.34,2142.9900000000002
but if she understands the whole process,2142.06,5.94,2145.0299999999997
if she has confidence in me if she knows,2145.66,3.419,2147.3695
that I'm going to be right there with,2148.0,2.88,2149.44
her to help her when she wants help,2149.079,4.921,2151.5395000000003
if she trusts me better for battle isn't,2150.88,6.479,2154.1195000000002
it yes it is and then after,2154.0,5.64,2156.82
having the baby in the room with her,2157.359,4.021,2159.3695
I'm trying to persuade my mothers to go,2159.64,3.0,2161.14
back to caring for their babies,2161.38,2.4,2162.58
themselves,2162.64,4.199,2164.7394999999997
feeding themselves bathing them being,2163.78,4.98,2166.27
close to them instead of handing them,2166.839,3.421,2168.5495
over to some nurse,2168.76,3.24,2170.38
I know this is a lot to ask of your,2170.26,4.2,2172.36
daughter it's a full-time job,2172.0,5.82,2174.91
but believe me the rewards will be great,2174.46,5.94,2177.43
not only for the baby but the cave,2177.82,5.22,2180.4300000000003

Doctor you were nice to give her so much,2185.56,4.2,2187.66
of your time it's to my advantage if I,2187.48,3.48,2189.22

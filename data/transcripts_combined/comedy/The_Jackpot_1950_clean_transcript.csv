uh i'm just thinking sir,368.72,4.96,371.20000000000005
best friend well mr woodruff i think we,371.52,3.679,373.35949999999997
all have to get together put our,373.68,4.239,375.7995
shoulders to the wheel and push,375.199,3.921,377.15950000000004
where or even whom,379.12,3.68,380.96
well what i meant is that if i know what,381.039,3.921,382.9995
you meant i don't want slogans i want,382.8,5.04,385.32
ideas i can ring up in the cash register,384.96,4.959,387.43949999999995
i can remember back in 1943 when we had,387.84,5.04,390.35999999999996
24 sales girls and 200 customers oh well,389.919,5.761,392.79949999999997
but there was a war going on in 1943 now,392.88,5.439,395.5995
there's a man who knows history,395.68,5.12,398.24
i'm not asking for 1943 to come back,398.319,4.0,400.319
all i want is to be able to look down on,400.8,2.72,402.16
that floor and see that we don't,402.319,2.801,403.71950000000004

back from europe and find the vacant lot,431.44,5.159,434.0195

do mrs lloyd how do you do mr ferguson's,2636.88,3.52,2638.6400000000003
a tax consultant he's going to figure,2638.96,3.44,2640.68
out just exactly what our taxes will be,2640.4,3.919,2642.3595
and the best way to meet it the best way,2642.4,4.16,2644.48
to meet a tax mr lawrence is to pay it i,2644.319,3.76,2646.199
always like to have it understood at the,2646.56,3.36,2648.24
outset that i do not assist in any,2648.079,3.76,2649.9590000000003
income tax evasion i'm not trying to get,2649.92,3.679,2651.7595
away with anything it's impossible to,2651.839,3.441,2653.5595
get away with anything mr lawrence i'm,2653.599,4.0,2655.599
not trying to good now let's have no,2655.28,6.76,2658.6600000000003
further misunderstanding on that score,2657.599,4.441,2659.8195
you know how much i don't know,2663.44,3.679,2665.2795
ah here it is,2665.44,3.52,2667.2000000000003
the latest ruling from the bureau of,2667.119,4.24,2669.239
internal revenue states that,2668.96,4.879,2671.3995
loot shall be considered income and as,2671.359,5.281,2673.9995
such taxable at the fair market value in,2673.839,5.361,2676.5195
other words the retail price therefore,2676.64,4.959,2679.1195
your jackpot winnings plus your year's,2679.2,4.879,2681.6394999999998
salary less all legitimate deductions,2681.599,4.961,2684.0795000000003
will bring your tax to not less than,2684.079,5.52,2686.8390000000004
seven thousand dollars,2686.56,5.2,2689.16
seven thousand dollars oh no where am i,2689.599,3.921,2691.5595000000003
gonna get seven thousand dollars well,2691.76,3.52,2693.5200000000004
that is a question since i noticed from,2693.52,3.92,2695.48
your figures that you have only 496,2695.28,3.52,2697.0400000000004
dollars in the bank,2697.44,3.2,2699.04
well i i'll just have to get busy and,2698.8,3.039,2700.3195
sell some of this stuff it's the only,2700.64,2.88,2702.08
way out why don't we just send the,2701.839,3.28,2703.479
government the things we don't want the,2703.52,4.4,2705.72
government only wants money mrs lawrence,2705.119,4.881,2707.5595000000003

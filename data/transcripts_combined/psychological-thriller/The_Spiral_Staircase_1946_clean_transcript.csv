same fellow did the first one same fella,323.639,4.261,325.7695
did the second one but who he is I don't,325.74,4.44,327.96000000000004
know somebody in this town somebody we,327.9,4.44,330.12

my desk anybody be quiet,337.979,3.321,339.6395
didn't know you was called Dr Perry I,356.28,4.5,358.53
wasn't as I was leaving the office I,358.86,3.48,360.6
heard about the murder and thought I'd,360.78,2.759,362.1595
drop in and see if there's anything I,362.34,3.359,364.0195
could do well there ain't unless of,363.539,3.361,365.2195
you're a good enough doctor to uncork or,366.9,4.079,368.93949999999995
Miracle and bring the dead back to life,368.82,4.26,370.95
I don't think I'm that good,370.979,4.5,373.229
there's no sense new going up she's dead,373.08,4.619,375.3895
all right Dr Harvey's up there and,375.479,4.741,377.8495
that's what he says she's dead well in,377.699,3.901,379.6495
that event Constable I certainly can't,380.22,4.039,382.2395
do her any harm,381.6,2.659,382.9295
hello Perry,388.52,3.64,390.34
there's nothing for you to do unless you,392.16,3.42,393.87
just want to do some sightseeing how is,393.6,4.2,395.70000000000005
she killed strangled she was dead when,395.58,4.98,398.07
we got here who was she that lame girl,397.8,6.32,400.96000000000004
left to work toward Nelsons,400.56,3.56,402.34
she was just in my office last week did,408.3,4.56,410.58
you pay our bill or was this her way of,410.759,4.201,412.8595
getting a hold of it,412.86,4.08,414.90000000000003
I haven't enough experience to make that,414.96,4.44,417.18
sort of joke perhaps not Dr Perry,416.94,4.68,419.28
I'll run alone oh just a minute,419.4,3.96,421.38
I hear you we're over to see Mr Stover,421.62,4.56,423.9
last night yes I was don't you know he's,423.36,4.679,425.6995
my patient I only went because they,426.18,3.359,427.8595
called me because they told me that,428.039,3.361,429.7195
you'd refused to go into a morning I,429.539,3.6,431.339
thought it might be serious you've got a,431.4,3.9,433.34999999999997
lot to learn young fellow you've only,433.139,3.481,434.8795
been here a short time I've been here,435.3,2.82,436.71000000000004
for a good many years,436.62,3.18,438.21
if I answered all the courses that came,438.12,3.78,440.01
along I wouldn't get any sleep at all,439.8,3.54,441.57
well that's why I think there's room for,441.9,3.12,443.46
two doctors in this town,443.34,3.479,445.0795
I can tell but let the competition be on,445.02,4.019,447.0295
an open plane ethics you get what I mean,446.819,3.961,448.7995
Parry if ever I'm called on an emergency,449.039,4.021,451.04949999999997
and you have to be sleeping I intend to,450.78,3.18,452.36999999999995
that's very Noble and ambitious,453.96,3.78,455.84999999999997
don't let anything discourage you,456.24,3.72,458.1
nothing will,457.74,4.38,459.93
oh by the way,459.96,3.78,461.84999999999997
you might like to see what this story,462.12,3.299,463.7695
did to that prescription you wrote last,463.74,3.92,465.7
I'm gonna make some calls Helen I'll,492.8,5.44,495.52000000000004
take you through the crossroads,495.36,5.519,498.1195
were you at the hotel,498.24,4.26,500.37
was a very nice thing to have happen in,500.879,3.861,502.8095
your afternoon,502.5,2.24,503.62
I've been pretty busy lately,505.379,3.061,506.90950000000004
I haven't had much of a chance to drop,507.06,2.699,508.4095
in and see you,508.44,2.699,509.7895
but I've been thinking about you a great,509.759,1.581,510.5495
you have many family Helen no one else,513.0,3.719,514.8595
to worry about you,514.68,3.719,516.5395
and I got to wondering just how long you,516.719,3.781,518.6095
were going on like this,518.399,4.02,520.409
I mean doing the work you you're doing,520.5,4.08,522.54
at the Waterhouse,522.419,6.501,525.6695
you wanted to be a nurse teaching,524.58,4.34,526.75
you mean you're going to give up that,529.26,3.54,531.03
without making an effort to get your,530.519,3.211,532.1245
voice back again,532.8,3.599,534.5994999999999
yes I know Helen you did see a doctor,536.399,2.94,537.869
that was a long time ago it might have,539.339,4.261,541.4695
discovered a lot since then,541.68,5.659,544.5095
there are specialists in Boston now,543.6,3.739,545.4695
I don't want to build your hoax up Helen,548.279,5.041,550.7995
seems such a shame to give up so ease of,551.339,4.101,553.3895000000001
you'd rather I wouldn't talk about it,555.899,3.921,557.8595
wouldn't you,557.459,2.361,558.6395
all right I won't,560.1,3.739,561.9695
you know the words of that too,571.26,3.259,572.8895
Dr Perry Dr Perry,585.86,8.2,589.96
oh Freddy's classic Dr Perry bad they,594.06,5.399,596.7594999999999
didn't send you for me did they sent me,597.48,4.32,599.64
for Dr Harvey but Paul wants you to come,599.459,4.201,601.5595
I'm afraid I can't help you out this,601.8,4.14,603.87
time Freddy you don't understand your,603.66,4.14,605.73
father's Dr Harvey's patient we'll have,605.94,3.66,607.7700000000001
to try and find him for you I'll call,607.8,4.32,609.9599999999999
him as soon as I get home oh please Dr,609.6,5.38,612.2900000000001
Perry you come I want you,612.12,4.44,614.34
to go up and have a look I'll run you,616.56,3.899,618.5094999999999
home afterwards,619.019,3.621,620.8295
afraid you'll be late,620.459,5.541,623.2294999999999
you sure you'll be all right,626.339,4.001,628.3395
you go straight home won't you help,628.2,28.589,642.4945
they phoned us about the murder,831.3,4.74,833.67
for a while I thought it might have been,834.36,3.979,836.3495
terrible that's what it is,841.079,3.56,842.8589999999999
n't bad enough murdering people but all,845.639,5.041,848.1595
these defenseless women,848.639,4.26,850.769
first it was the girl with a scar on her,850.68,5.159,853.2595
face then that poor simple-minded,852.899,4.081,854.9395
and now this it seems like,856.98,6.539,860.2495
you've had enough of one afternoon now,861.24,4.2,863.34
now get your wet shoes off before you,863.519,3.841,865.4395
catch a death and you better get up to,865.44,4.38,867.6300000000001
Mrs Warren straight away she's raising a,867.36,4.02,869.37
rhombus with that nurse of hers again,869.82,4.519,872.0795
won't even allow her in the room now,871.38,5.519,874.1395
she sent down word for you to go up the,874.339,4.421,876.5495000000001
moment you came in,876.899,5.601,879.6995000000001
is that someone at the front door,878.76,3.74,880.63
who's there,899.66,4.97,902.145
I don't understand I closed that window,912.199,6.301,915.3494999999999
when the storm started,915.6,7.07,919.135
I'll get a hammer and fix that shutter,918.5,13.96,925.48
it was him,938.16,6.38,941.35
Carlton bad dog,940.62,3.92,942.58
out all day and only home in time to get,948.0,5.56,950.78
under my feet and break my,950.76,6.68,954.1
and you're out caught in the neighbor's,957.44,4.44,959.6600000000001
Carlton you deserve a good beating,964.8,6.02,967.81
guess I better dry you first,968.579,4.681,970.9195
definitely cold that's what you will,973.26,5.16,975.84
if you think this is all I've got to do,976.139,5.241,978.7595
you're mistaken,978.42,2.96,979.9
I think I better fix that window first,981.66,6.979,985.1495
I hope that Carlton is all that came in,984.24,4.399,986.4395
I won't need you you better get up to,989.639,4.711,991.9945
Mrs Warren,991.92,37.919,1010.8795

the sight of me but then I can't stand,1125.539,4.561,1127.8195
the sight of her either,1128.12,4.02,1130.1299999999999

I hate the board here at this time of,1343.039,6.38,1346.229

yes so I've heard,1353.0,4.679,1355.3395

the murderer to this vicinity,1357.679,4.921,1360.1395

oh dude I'm so unhappy,2040.12,6.799,2043.5194999999999
where were you this afternoon why,2048.82,4.14,2050.8900000000003
those are mine I know,2053.5,3.5,2055.25
so you've unmasked me well I don't know,2058.24,4.56,2060.52
whether I've unmasked you or not,2061.06,3.0,2062.56
but I don't know why you told her,2062.8,2.4,2064.0
Constable you weren't out this afternoon,2064.06,3.42,2065.77
when obviously you were well to be,2065.2,3.78,2067.0899999999997
completely honest with you I didn't want,2067.48,3.0,2068.98
to discuss it in front of anyone well,2068.98,3.119,2070.5395
how stupid of you,2070.48,3.06,2072.01
if anyone had seen you you would have,2072.099,3.78,2073.989
made it very awkward for all of us,2073.54,4.859,2075.9695
where were you,2075.879,4.441,2078.0995
Professor right Lance would you be good,2078.399,4.581,2080.6895
enough to leave us,2080.32,2.66,2081.65
let's stop sparring you're angry because,2092.619,4.5,2094.869
I took Blanche out,2094.78,4.38,2096.9700000000003
you're angry because since I've been,2097.119,4.381,2099.3095000000003
home Blanche and I have gotten to know,2099.16,4.56,2101.44
each other pretty well you know Stephen,2101.5,4.859,2103.9295
you almost did smirk even when you were,2103.72,4.86,2106.1499999999996
a child it's one of the things my father,2106.359,4.321,2108.5195
disliked about you,2108.58,5.1,2111.13
it was my father too,2110.68,4.32,2112.8399999999997
you know I'm inclined to think that,2113.68,2.939,2115.1495
father was disappointed in both of us,2115.0,4.02,2117.01
neither of us Spirit his concept of what,2116.619,4.681,2118.9595
a real man should be a gun-toten hard,2119.02,4.2,2121.12
drinking tough living God-fearing,2121.3,3.6,2123.1000000000004
he always used to say,2124.9,5.52,2127.6600000000003
strong survive the week died,2126.82,6.0,2129.82
how wrong he was Albert,2130.42,5.52,2133.1800000000003
because you and I,2132.82,5.96,2135.8
have inherited the Earth,2138.82,3.44,2140.54
I'll be honest with you Stephen,2143.14,5.4,2145.8399999999997
I don't like you I never have,2145.42,4.919,2147.8795
I've never trusted you,2148.54,3.36,2150.22
and you're quite right when you say that,2150.339,3.601,2152.1394999999998
I don't like this this interest you,2151.9,3.84,2153.82
haven't Blanche,2153.94,3.659,2155.7695
and I'll tell you something else I've,2155.74,3.18,2157.33
had the responsibility of your mother,2157.599,4.5,2159.849
your mother not mine for years I'm tired,2158.92,5.4,2161.62
and strained therefore I think we should,2162.099,3.421,2163.8095000000003
make a decision,2164.32,3.0,2165.82
either you make up your mind to go away,2165.52,4.62,2167.83
permanently or if you're like you stay,2167.32,5.48,2170.06
you look as though you lost your best,2186.46,2.58,2187.75
you've got nothing to worry about,2189.04,3.24,2190.66
if anybody tried in their funny business,2190.72,4.859,2193.1495
on you I'd soon suck them in the jar,2192.28,6.18,2195.3700000000003
look at it this way Helen murders like a,2195.579,4.921,2198.0395000000003
million dollar lottery sure it is,2198.46,3.3,2200.11
you pick up the newspaper you see,2201.76,3.72,2203.6200000000003
someone's picture who's won a million,2203.92,2.52,2205.1800000000003
you pick up another paper there's a,2206.44,4.02,2208.4500000000003
picture of someone who's been murdered,2208.72,4.8,2211.12
there's never me it was never you it's,2210.46,5.46,2213.19
always somebody else isn't it the safety,2213.52,5.22,2216.13
in numbers Helen the votes and me and,2215.92,5.04,2218.44
the professor and Stephen,2218.74,5.099,2221.2895
we'll look after you and there's Carlton,2220.96,4.32,2223.12
shouldn't count too much on him,2225.28,3.68,2227.1200000000003
and there's nurse Barker she'd be as,2234.16,4.56,2236.44
good as any man in fact sometimes I,2236.56,4.88,2239.0
think she is a man,2238.72,2.72,2240.08
in case you're interested,2241.839,3.321,2243.4995
there's someone at the front door,2246.82,3.74,2248.69
what do you want I was called to see Mrs,2262.359,5.841,2265.2795
Warren which Dr Perry was he called,2264.16,4.04,2266.18

I know you were very fond of him,2316.06,4.98,2318.5499999999997

first wife,2321.04,4.94,2323.5099999999998
but I was a much better shot,2322.24,3.74,2324.1099999999997
the only kind of beauty he had any,2327.339,6.78,2330.729
respect for was strength their two sons,2329.32,6.9,2332.77
both weaklings,2334.119,5.581,2336.9095
they hated guns and hunting,2336.22,5.94,2339.1899999999996

he got his release battle,2344.079,6.441,2347.2995

you can take it to Dr Patty,2667.66,4.04,2669.68
coming to the den I want to talk to you,2677.859,4.381,2680.0495
this is Warren's asleep,2679.54,6.26,2682.67
Professor Warren's with or not,2682.24,3.56,2684.02
I've been thinking things over Mrs,2687.76,3.54,2689.53
Warren's right,2689.92,3.3,2691.57
you should come with me tonight,2691.3,3.36,2692.98
you can stay at my mother's place until,2693.22,4.619,2695.5294999999996
we can make arrangements to go to Boston,2694.66,6.32,2697.8199999999997
my mother will like you,2697.839,3.141,2699.4094999999998
I don't want to Fright you Helen but you,2701.38,3.42,2703.09
heard Mrs Warren a while ago,2702.94,4.02,2704.9500000000003
her mind's growing steadily worse and,2704.8,4.08,2706.84
I'm afraid she may become violent,2706.96,4.02,2708.9700000000003
she seems obsessed by the idea that you,2708.88,4.08,2710.92
get out of this house,2710.98,5.9,2713.93
and there may be something back of it,2712.96,3.92,2714.92
you'll go with me tonight,2717.339,4.141,2719.4094999999998
there are doctors in Boston who know all,2719.68,3.3,2721.33
about your case,2721.48,3.9,2723.43
I want to take you there,2722.98,5.0,2725.48
when I left you this afternoon I dropped,2729.64,3.66,2731.47
into the famous they have a guest,2731.38,4.8,2733.78
visiting them from your hometown uh,2733.3,6.22,2736.4100000000003
Mrs Lindstrom thank you Noah,2736.18,6.419,2739.3894999999998
she told me a story about a girl,2747.52,5.16,2750.1
a girl was on her way home from school,2750.94,3.54,2752.71
she had good news for her parents,2754.48,3.56,2756.26
when she wasn't far from her home,2758.38,4.56,2760.6600000000003
she heard a fire engine rushing down the,2760.96,2.82,2762.37
she started to run when she turned the,2763.78,4.02,2765.7900000000004
corner she saw that it was her home that,2766.18,4.28,2768.3199999999997
was in flames,2767.8,2.66,2769.13
she wanted to scream herself but somehow,2772.24,3.119,2773.7994999999996
she couldn't,2774.099,3.181,2775.6895
she tried to rush into the house but was,2775.359,5.341,2778.0295
held back because it was hopeless so,2777.28,4.98,2779.77
without being able to do one thing to,2780.7,2.34,2781.87
she saw her mother and father burned to,2783.04,4.46,2785.27
I'm sorry Helen but I had to do it,2792.119,5.681,2794.9595
it's only because I wanted to help you,2796.359,3.361,2798.0395
go over everything that happened that,2797.8,2.76,2799.1800000000003
have the courage to see it all again and,2800.56,4.2,2802.66
by not blocking it out of your mind you,2803.02,4.7,2805.37
may find your voice again,2804.76,2.96,2806.2400000000002
I don't like being an outsider you,2809.92,3.96,2811.9
shouldn't either I know what I'm talking,2812.079,4.081,2814.1195000000002
about because I'm an outsider here,2813.88,4.26,2816.01
myself a lot of people don't want me,2816.16,4.26,2818.29
they want me to quit but I won't,2818.14,4.08,2820.18
because there's at least one person who,2820.42,3.48,2822.16
wants me here and that's good enough for,2822.22,4.379,2824.4094999999998
me and there's one person who wants you,2823.9,4.14,2825.9700000000003
to talk and that ought to be good enough,2826.599,3.541,2828.3695000000002
for you look at me,2828.04,3.66,2829.87
look at me,2830.14,3.06,2831.67
you remember how wonderful it was when,2831.7,3.06,2833.23
you had a voice when you could say hello,2833.2,4.02,2835.21
well thank you when you get yelled back,2834.76,4.319,2836.9195000000004
at someone who started picking it I do,2837.22,3.119,2838.7794999999996
it all the time,2839.079,2.52,2840.3390000000004
you look at me as though you don't,2840.339,3.361,2842.0195
believe it but I know I'm right,2841.599,7.281,2845.2395
try to talk try it try it,2843.7,5.18,2846.29
my mother is asking for you Helen,2854.319,3.741,2856.1895
I'll speak to Professor Warren about,2860.5,4.099,2862.5495
your leading,2861.94,2.659,2863.2695
what is this about Helen leaving,2865.119,4.441,2867.3395
I'll disguise it with your brother,2867.64,3.479,2869.3795
is it something you can't discuss with,2869.56,2.519,2870.8195
why is she leaving where is she going,2872.079,4.321,2874.2395
I've been doing a great deal of thinking,2876.4,3.36,2878.08
about Helen I know our condition is due,2877.78,3.42,2879.4900000000002
I'm sure a new mental therapy can,2881.2,4.02,2883.21
restore a voice I'd like to take it to,2883.18,3.72,2885.04
Boston don't you think you're taking a,2885.22,3.359,2886.8995
tremendous responsibility building up,2886.9,3.719,2888.7595
our hopes making you think there's some,2888.579,3.721,2890.4395
miracle in store for,2890.619,4.621,2892.9295
it's up to her not you,2892.3,6.24,2895.42
what you're doing is cruel and foolish,2895.24,5.099,2897.7895
that girl is adjusted to her Affliction,2898.54,3.48,2900.2799999999997
I think you should let it go with that,2900.339,4.681,2902.6794999999997
suppose you let me mind my own business,2902.02,4.74,2904.39
it so happens I don't think much of your,2905.02,3.72,2906.88
business Dr Perry,2906.76,3.96,2908.7400000000002
there is a solution to Helen's problem I,2908.74,3.18,2910.33
think that solution ought to be in the,2910.72,2.399,2911.9195
hands of someone other than a country,2911.92,3.419,2913.6295
hick doctor the only thing that keeps me,2913.119,3.901,2915.0695
from cracking you in the George the,2915.339,3.24,2916.959
almost second possibility that would,2917.02,4.22,2919.13
break your neck,2918.579,2.661,2919.9095
the good country doctor having lost his,2922.24,3.24,2923.8599999999997
it's about to resort to his fists,2925.48,4.08,2927.52
Professor Warren I know you're,2927.76,3.66,2929.59
interested in Helen's welfare,2929.56,3.48,2931.2999999999997
I told you what I've learned about it,2931.42,3.3,2933.07
and I've decided it's for her best,2933.04,2.88,2934.48
interest that she leave here tonight,2934.72,4.139,2936.7895
tonight yes you can stay at my mother's,2935.92,4.5,2938.17
place until we can take it to Boston for,2938.859,2.821,2940.2695
the examination first thing in the,2940.42,2.939,2941.8895
well doctor you know that I agree with,2943.359,3.541,2945.1295
you about the element of hope that you,2945.46,3.359,2947.1395
have for Helen but,2946.9,3.78,2948.79
what's your reason for suddenly making,2948.819,3.601,2950.6195
you leave tonight,2950.68,4.62,2952.99
Mrs Warren fields,2952.42,5.7,2955.27
that she's in danger here,2955.3,6.66,2958.63
and surely you don't take the ramblings,2961.96,3.42,2963.67
of a sick woman seriously,2963.52,4.74,2965.89
I take most things seriously,2965.38,5.16,2967.96
do there are many other considerations,2968.26,4.5,2970.51
Helen needs this position it's her only,2970.54,4.02,2972.55
means of support no family it won't be,2972.76,3.18,2974.3500000000004
easy for it I thought of all those,2974.56,2.94,2976.0299999999997
things professing,2975.94,3.179,2977.5295
I intend to take care of,2979.119,5.521,2981.8795
oh I see well I'm very glad for you and,2981.4,5.52,2984.1600000000003
for her you're a sentimentalist doctor,2984.64,4.199,2986.7394999999997
tell me you're your humanitarian,2986.92,3.659,2988.7495
instincts restricted only to people with,2988.839,3.24,2990.459
serious afflictions,2990.579,3.921,2992.5395000000003
you're very insolent it's Dr Perry,2995.76,5.04,2998.28
yes he is just a moment,3014.46,4.1,3016.51
it's for you doctor thank you,3019.26,3.68,3021.1000000000004

and forsaking all others keep thee only,3185.16,5.159,3187.7394999999997
so long as ye both shall live,3190.319,8.661,3194.6495
signify by saying I do,3194.819,4.161,3196.8995

well I don't know whether Dr Perry is,3253.92,3.96,3255.9
right or wrong but I agree that you,3255.78,4.26,3257.9100000000003
should have that chance to go to Boston,3257.88,3.719,3259.7395
and I want you to understand that things,3260.04,4.079,3262.0795
don't work out satisfactorily as you're,3261.599,4.561,3263.8795
always welcome to come here,3264.119,5.0,3266.619

I like to see women cry,3302.94,3.8,3304.84
men like to see women cry it makes them,3308.579,5.24,3311.199
feel Superior,3311.099,2.72,3312.4590000000003
nap you dramatize everything Blanche,3319.92,6.48,3323.16

about what,3346.2,3.06,3347.73
just that I think you're uncomfortable,3347.76,3.9,3349.71
because of your uh past relationship,3349.26,5.059,3351.7895000000003
with my brother,3351.66,2.659,3352.9894999999997

I didn't realize you were so strong,3372.599,5.821,3375.5095
I'm living here I never want to see you,3375.72,3.599,3377.5195
I'll miss you,3379.319,5.04,3381.839

I'm only taking a few things with me,3432.599,2.821,3434.0095

window tonight I definitely know I did,3462.059,6.78,3465.449
now if only I knew who opened it you're,3465.42,4.919,3467.8795
not that clever,3468.839,4.701,3471.1895
and if you were,3470.339,3.201,3471.9395
you scared the life out of me,3617.64,3.979,3619.6295
I told you not to touch me get out,3670.5,5.339,3673.1695

thousands of miles of wet helpless is,1028.209,4.951,1030.6845

what is all this just a formality are,3107.839,5.051,3110.3645
you quite certain you didn't visit mr.,3111.15,3.659,3112.9795
Fenton's flat last night quite certain,3112.89,3.3,3114.54
and how do you account for your,3114.809,2.611,3116.1145
fingerprints being found their,3116.19,3.659,3118.0195
fingerprints oh they must have been left,3117.42,3.899,3119.3695000000002
in the last time I was there when was,3119.849,3.661,3121.6795
that about two or three weeks ago,3121.319,4.141,3123.3894999999998
do you think mr. Fenton would have left,3123.51,3.63,3125.3250000000003
a whiskey glass on his table for three,3125.46,3.96,3127.44
weeks no of course not and perhaps you,3127.14,3.36,3128.8199999999997
wouldn't mind telling me what really,3129.42,1.59,3130.215
very well I went there for a drink when,3131.01,5.01,3133.5150000000003
was this well I dropped mrs. Warren off,3133.98,4.29,3136.125
at her flat at about 11:30 and I thought,3136.02,3.87,3137.955
I'd call round and see Vicki he wasn't,3138.27,3.93,3140.235
inside a drinkin lift and he was out how,3139.89,4.83,3142.305
did you get in I am no I had a key you,3142.2,4.2,3144.2999999999997
mr. found it I left it on the table by,3144.72,3.66,3146.5499999999997
mistake so you arrived just before,3146.4,5.82,3149.31
midnight did about that doctor puts the,3148.38,5.219,3150.9895
time of fentons death a few minutes,3152.22,3.329,3153.8844999999997
either side of midnight so you see mr.,3153.599,3.48,3155.339
Martin it looked as if Fenton was in his,3155.549,3.27,3157.184
flat when you called but I swear to you,3157.079,3.811,3158.9845
he wasn't now wait a minute I didn't,3158.819,4.081,3160.8595
look in the kitchen you mean he might,3160.89,3.03,3162.4049999999997
have been lying in there and you,3162.9,2.219,3164.0095
wouldn't have known anything about it,3163.92,3.389,3165.6145
well it's possible who didn't go to the,3165.119,4.171,3167.2045000000003
kitchen for water or soda or anything no,3167.309,4.081,3169.3495000000003
I had to explain your fingerprints being,3169.29,3.84,3171.21
found on the kitchen doorknob what oh,3171.39,3.51,3173.145
yes well I started to get at the kitchen,3173.13,3.06,3174.6600000000003
but I couldn't find the light switch and,3174.9,3.689,3176.7445000000002
I just didn't bother,3176.19,4.2,3178.29
I'm sorry mr. Martin but I don't believe,3178.589,3.661,3180.4195
a word you're saying I don't he'll then,3180.39,2.76,3181.77
I've told you the truth,3182.25,2.369,3183.4345
family haven't guessed yet still on this,3183.15,2.969,3184.6345
morning if the deceased have been lying,3184.619,2.551,3185.8945000000003
in the kitchen when you were there you,3186.119,2.7,3187.469
must have smelt the guests did I did I,3187.17,4.35,3189.3450000000003
remember now I said I mean I thought it,3188.819,5.161,3191.3995
was a leak what's all this about anyway,3191.52,4.02,3193.53
the suicide wasn't it nice but that,3193.98,3.51,3195.735
before this morning remember,3195.54,3.72,3197.4
yes but miss Fenton was telling me that,3197.49,3.629,3199.3044999999997
he left a letter well what makes you,3199.26,3.12,3200.82
think that letter showed he intended,3201.119,2.791,3202.5145
killing himself if you let me read it,3202.38,5.209,3204.9845
I'll tell you oh here's a copy,3203.91,3.679,3205.7495
it's pretty obvious answer explains,3210.01,3.82,3211.92
everything,3213.2,2.61,3214.5049999999997
not quite everything mr. Martin the,3213.83,3.33,3215.495
deceit found it difficult to write a,3215.81,2.64,3217.13
letter giving up the woman he loved,3217.16,3.39,3218.855
anyone under those circumstances might,3218.45,4.14,3220.52
have written a dozen letters we know for,3220.55,4.23,3222.665
a fact that he wrote to you've just read,3222.59,6.42,3225.8
one now I'll show you the other do you,3224.78,6.27,3227.9150000000004
mean the letter firm but the body was to,3229.01,3.93,3230.9750000000004
have ended the same way as that one,3231.05,4.14,3233.1200000000003
precisely he couldn't write a letter,3232.94,4.11,3234.995
like that at the first attempt who could,3235.19,3.51,3236.945
so he threw it away,3237.05,3.84,3238.9700000000003
the murderer interrupted him while he,3238.7,4.23,3240.8149999999996
was writing another killed him and,3240.89,3.84,3242.81
finding the half-completed letter on the,3242.93,3.54,3244.7
desk realized that there was the final,3244.73,3.99,3246.725
link to make it look like suicide he,3246.47,3.42,3248.18
didn't know about the full letter in the,3248.72,3.27,3250.355
waste paper basket waiting to put the,3249.89,3.72,3251.75
noose around his neck but I didn't do it,3251.99,3.72,3253.85
tincture no and I can prove it now he,3253.61,3.54,3255.38
was family's head in the oven wasn't he,3255.71,3.06,3257.2400000000002
how could I make him do that why it's,3257.15,3.03,3258.665
ridiculous come on dick Oh check,3258.77,2.46,3260.0
sticking hit me I'm going to turn the,3260.18,2.37,3261.365
tap on we'll come onto that now if you,3261.23,3.54,3263.0
like you see Martin you were very clever,3262.55,3.6,3264.3500000000004
and you know it but one or two things,3264.77,3.09,3266.315
are gonna trip you up like the letter,3266.15,4.86,3268.58
and this what is it I was going to ask,3267.86,5.25,3270.485
you well never seen that thing before,3271.01,3.99,3273.005
when we searched your car we found this,3273.11,3.24,3274.73
in the booth I've never seen their thing,3275.0,2.37,3276.185
before someone must have put it in my,3276.35,2.88,3277.79
car anyway why should I want to kill,3277.37,3.45,3279.095
Vicki because he was in love with mrs.,3279.23,2.91,3280.685
Warren - nonsense,3280.82,3.81,3282.7250000000004
is it I'll tell you this Martin in the,3282.14,4.68,3284.48
whole of my experience I've never seen a,3284.63,3.87,3286.565
cooler more carefully planned and,3286.82,3.0,3288.32
premeditated murder,3288.5,3.21,3290.105
I've already cautioned you and I shall,3289.82,3.33,3291.485
now arrest you for the willful murder of,3291.71,3.18,3293.3
Richard Fenton you're making a great,3293.15,3.9,3295.1
mistake inspector take him away folks,3294.89,4.88,3297.33
I'll be over in a few minutes,3297.05,2.72,3298.4100000000003
that young man of yours seems to be,3311.63,6.39,3314.8250000000003
hitting the headlines who cheat yourself,3313.65,4.37,3315.835
Jimmy didn't kill him he couldn't have,3320.36,3.79,3322.255
no of course not,3323.34,2.16,3324.42
gosh it will be them all the time but,3324.15,7.08,3327.69
you I don't know what you mean good,3325.5,16.11,3333.555
morning thank you you know Jimmy didn't,3331.23,11.61,3337.035
kill Fenton because he never left our,3341.61,3.51,3343.3650000000002
side all the evening how do you know,3342.84,5.85,3345.7650000000003
that did I happen to be that we're in,3345.12,6.77,3348.505
fentons fair but you couldn't have been,3348.69,4.89,3351.135
unless you John,3351.89,16.93,3360.355
unless I killed him no no you how could,3353.58,16.5,3361.83
you have done it when you didn't even,3368.82,4.53,3371.085
know about it I found out that's easy in,3370.08,4.32,3372.24
fact I only made one mistake,3373.35,3.03,3374.865
what is that I thought Fenton was the,3374.4,3.87,3376.335
only man in your life he tried to tell,3376.38,2.85,3377.8050000000003
me there were others but I didn't,3378.27,2.37,3379.455
believe it until you came in with Jimmy,3379.23,3.65,3381.055
then it was too late so no repentance ed,3380.64,4.92,3383.1
said you can't kill em all you fool well,3382.88,4.72,3385.2400000000002
it was probably right Fenton and Jimmy,3385.56,3.42,3387.27
in one day is a pretty good start isn't,3387.6,6.24,3390.72
it now what is it first adjust cam well,3388.98,6.57,3392.265
put them over there no give them to me,3393.84,4.04,3395.86
with a breeze,3395.55,2.33,3396.715
you don't expect me to believe any of,3400.85,3.7,3402.7
this to you I don't see why not it's all,3402.96,3.66,3404.79
quite - I worked out a foolproof plan,3404.55,4.23,3406.665
for killing Fenton and Jimmy turned up i,3406.62,3.87,3408.555
replant things a little putting the,3408.78,2.82,3410.19
pillow slip in the back of his car for,3410.49,2.97,3411.975
instance instead of destroying it if we,3411.6,3.09,3413.145
don't pay the telephone bill in seven,3413.46,3.63,3415.275
days we're gonna be cut off you mean to,3414.69,3.84,3416.61
tell me you wearing Vincent's left that,3417.09,4.05,3419.1150000000002
night but he was dying there why we were,3418.53,5.19,3421.125
talking in the next room Declan I don't,3421.14,3.12,3422.7
believe it,3423.72,2.97,3425.205
oh you don't yet do I have to write you,3424.26,7.65,3428.085
a letter mr. Martin remember I see your,3426.69,6.27,3429.8250000000003
mother wants to come and stay with us,3431.91,2.58,3433.2
Rush's doors write to me I don't know,3432.96,2.73,3434.325
perhaps you think I'm kind of harder,3434.49,4.89,3436.935
than our daughter after you and Jimmy,3435.69,5.28,3438.33
had left I fiddled round fentons flat,3439.38,3.15,3440.955
and the more I fiddle the blacker things,3440.97,2.67,3442.305
began to look for James,3442.53,2.43,3443.7450000000003
you wouldn't really,3443.64,2.79,3445.035
an innocent man suffer for something you,3444.96,3.12,3446.52
did I suffer because of something he did,3446.43,2.7,3447.7799999999997
that's different,3448.08,3.36,3449.7599999999998
not to me I made up my mind to get my,3449.13,3.959,3451.1095

him wouldn't you,3459.42,3.09,3460.965
yes but now you're going to be in the,3460.17,3.99,3462.165
interesting position of knowing that,3462.51,3.15,3464.085
he's innocent of a time guilt in that,3464.16,3.54,3465.93
you can't do anything about it you're,3465.66,4.679,3467.9995
going to suffer slowly and excuses and,3467.7,6.95,3471.1749999999997
I'm going to enjoy watching you squirm,3470.339,4.311,3472.4945

anything to do to help well there isn't,3647.619,6.48,3650.859
I knew you didn't do it so do i but it,3649.72,5.639,3652.5395

heal her because if they could hang me,3662.89,3.3,3664.54
on the evidence they got they could hang,3665.049,3.391,3666.7445
her just as easily as an accessory the,3666.19,3.809,3668.0945
significant thing is that pitifully,3668.44,3.21,3670.045
being in my car,3669.999,2.731,3671.3644999999997
must've put it there deliberately,3671.65,3.33,3673.315
whoever it was had a grudge against two,3672.73,4.14,3674.8
people Dicky and me and haters booze,3674.98,3.68,3676.82
enough to want to kill us,3676.87,8.43,3681.085
oh excuse me,3678.66,8.68,3683.0
nope I'm sorry but something very,3685.3,3.33,3686.965
important has come up on another case,3687.34,2.67,3688.675
would you mind very much if we postpone,3688.63,4.02,3690.6400000000003
our talk to another day no inspector of,3690.01,3.24,3691.63

all adds up perfectly Cooper don't you,3708.61,5.31,3711.2650000000003
think that's just because we were lucky,3712.72,2.4,3713.9199999999996
enough to come across the evidence,3713.92,3.99,3715.915
quickly sir maybe I was wondering,3715.12,4.08,3717.16
whether we were meant to come across it,3717.91,3.09,3719.455
you mean you you believed the boy when,3719.2,3.09,3720.745
he says someone else put the pillowcase,3721.0,4.77,3723.385
in his car I don't know all I do know is,3722.29,5.01,3724.795
that whoever planned this murder was a,3725.77,3.39,3727.465
clever man cool,3727.3,6.69,3730.645

you get on,3862.47,3.47,3864.205
when did you come back about half an,3880.41,6.01,3883.415
hour ago you might look as though you're,3883.87,6.51,3887.125

yeah tougher than I thought you were not,3914.19,6.46,3917.42
tough just logical and sensible you see,3916.75,5.88,3919.69
Lee I thought the whole business out,3920.65,4.95,3923.125
quietly and reasonably and I discovered,3922.63,4.28,3924.77
two very important things,3925.6,4.56,3927.88
what are they first that I love you and,3926.91,6.94,3930.3799999999997
second that you love me what makes you,3930.16,6.0,3933.16
think that why else should you be so,3933.85,3.78,3935.74
jealous of every man and so much as,3936.16,4.47,3938.395
looks at me why else should you kill,3937.63,7.26,3941.26
dick and Jimmy to make you suffer,3940.63,5.88,3943.57
something about I've suffered but,3944.89,4.38,3947.08
darling that's silly surely I never,3946.51,5.33,3949.175
loved them the way I love you,3949.27,5.81,3952.175
is that true of course it's true why did,3951.84,4.32,3954.0
you think I came back,3955.08,3.03,3956.595
why did you because I was worried about,3956.16,6.2,3959.2599999999998
you what in case you might do something,3958.11,6.91,3961.565
much doubt of that,3962.36,4.55,3964.635
because the responsibility for that boys,3965.02,5.19,3967.615
day is getting to a much more,3966.91,5.55,3969.685
yes it is I have been taught to do about,3970.21,5.369,3972.8945
it I can't think straight it's all my,3972.46,5.01,3974.965
fault I should have made you see this,3975.579,3.961,3977.5595000000003
nobody using,3977.47,4.81,3979.875
provide about Fenton and Martin they,3979.54,4.71,3981.895
never meant that much,3982.28,4.009,3984.2845
good why did you tell me because you,3984.25,6.319,3987.4095
weren't there I'm so bored without you,3986.289,4.28,3988.429
yes yes am but you're not completely,4002.82,5.49,4005.565
happy are you,4007.24,5.1,4009.79
no you're still worrying about you a lot,4008.31,7.54,4012.08
I can't let him hang now he's not going,4012.34,7.98,4016.33
to I'm gonna prevent that no yes yes I,4015.85,6.15,4018.9249999999997
must say that I was there oh then Jaggu,4020.32,2.51,4021.5750000000003
innocent accomplice,4022.0,2.85,4023.425
no there must be some other way some,4022.83,3.58,4024.62
loophole if only I didn't think of it,4024.85,4.05,4026.875
yes Lee that's right there must be,4026.41,4.2,4028.5099999999998
something you've forgotten no crime is,4028.9,4.17,4030.985
never perfect this one is too perfect I,4030.61,5.31,4033.2650000000003
thought of that I didn't know I was,4033.07,5.07,4035.605
going to want to undo it all again but,4035.92,3.75,4037.795
there must be something you've forgotten,4038.14,4.89,4040.585
there must be leave try to think please,4039.67,9.06,4044.2000000000003
try to think Oh Fox,4043.03,7.95,4047.005
so mr. Warren's been telling me the real,4048.73,4.77,4051.1150000000002
story behind fentons death see what you,4050.98,4.77,4053.3650000000002
think of it do you mind mr. Warren but,4053.5,3.69,4055.345
I've already told you would you mind,4055.75,3.66,4057.58
telling us again for sergeant Fox he's,4057.19,3.57,4058.975
been working on the case with me I'd,4059.41,2.99,4060.9049999999997
like him to hear it from the beginning,4060.76,5.28,4063.4
okay well as far as I can remember it,4062.4,5.71,4065.255
was like this on the day that I arrived,4066.04,4.26,4068.17
back from America I thought that my,4068.11,5.21,4070.715
office then bang up my wife wasn't it,4070.3,7.23,4073.915
deny reports terrible thing on her about,4073.32,7.18,4076.9100000000003
that's about 7 o'clock when I texted you,4077.53,5.01,4080.0350000000003
up outside and I saw my wife getting,4080.5,4.51,4082.755
into mountains car,4082.54,5.65,4085.365
I was naturally curious to know what was,4085.01,6.33,4088.175
going on in Durban I waited to deliver,4088.19,4.169,4090.2745
safely in the cup,4091.34,4.94,4093.81
and I tell my driver to follow,4092.359,3.921,4094.3195
they went to a restaurant led to the,4097.699,4.84,4100.119
theater when they came out after the,4100.289,4.41,4102.494
show I was there waiting for them I'd,4102.539,4.441,4104.7595
followed them again this time were flat,4104.699,3.021,4106.2095
at Temple Court,4106.98,2.95,4108.455
because I thought then that Martin was,4109.93,3.49,4111.675
the reason why not I hadn't written to,4111.98,3.66,4113.8099999999995
be an natural I thought the Dennises so,4113.42,3.78,4115.31
I waited outside about kidney didn't a,4115.64,3.21,4117.245
normally jealous husband have broken in,4117.2,3.42,4118.91
on them right away I wanted to be,4118.85,5.31,4121.505
certain cigarette so but I was funny,4120.62,6.29,4123.765
what I could do they came out again I,4124.16,4.92,4126.62
just had time to dodge around the corner,4126.91,4.0,4128.91
out of sight they were laughing and,4129.08,3.029,4130.5945
talking and I tried to catch it they,4130.91,3.0,4132.41
were saying don't I picked up is the,4132.109,5.431,4134.824500000001
man's name Jimmy and I didn't much like,4133.91,6.98,4137.4
the way she said it doesn't tell him,4137.54,3.35,4139.215
after they gun I tried the door which,4143.5,4.6,4145.8
was conveniently open as a matter of,4146.029,3.54,4147.799000000001
fact it was the catch hadn't dropped,4148.1,3.39,4149.795
they often don't unless you slam the,4149.569,2.341,4150.739500000001
it happens in my flat and I'm sure it,4151.91,3.8,4153.8099999999995
happens in yours so you went in I,4153.109,4.741,4155.4795
thought I'd wait and knock head out of,4155.71,5.069,4158.2445
this junior when I came back,4157.85,2.929,4159.3145
I look carefully around the apartment,4161.489,6.241,4164.6095
taking everything in and I went into the,4163.079,7.381,4166.769499999999
kitchen you know but I found there a man,4167.73,5.279,4170.3695
dare do this head in the gas up I turned,4170.46,4.009,4172.4645
off the gas and picked up the letter,4173.009,3.871,4174.9445
suggests the video when I read it I,4174.469,3.73,4176.334
realized the fat didn't belong did you,4176.88,3.149,4178.4545
belong to the other poor devil who,4178.199,5.34,4180.869
everyone and a thought struck me I could,4180.029,6.42,4183.2390000000005
turn this suicide into a murder done by,4183.539,5.1,4186.089
Jimmy that meant I had to get rid of,4186.449,3.991,4188.4445
every scrap of evidence and my wife had,4188.639,3.241,4190.2595
ever been in the flat it wasn't easy I,4190.44,3.0,4191.94
had to think fast,4191.88,8.67,4196.215
I put a cigarette stubs in a pot and I,4193.44,9.389,4198.134499999999
noticed a boy spin a basket is full of,4200.55,4.799,4202.949500000001
unfinished letters,4202.829,4.861,4205.2595
I look at some of them they were holding,4205.349,4.321,4207.5095
the same strain he'd obviously made half,4207.69,3.36,4209.37
a dozen shots at writing that favorite,4209.67,2.699,4211.0195
letter before he got hit the way you,4211.05,3.51,4212.805
wanted it one of them gave me another,4212.369,5.071,4214.9045
idea the best idea of all I left the,4214.56,4.2,4216.660000000001
finish letter in the waist of the basket,4217.44,4.11,4219.495
put all the rest in my pocket all except,4218.76,3.03,4220.275000000001
an unfinished one one you found beside,4221.79,7.77,4225.675
the body inspector then I washed the gas,4226.38,4.77,4228.765
giving a juicer to remove the,4229.56,3.51,4231.3150000000005
fingerprints how did you know which one,4231.15,2.64,4232.469999999999
by instinct no my lipstick no one in the,4233.79,7.8,4237.69
same way I got to do the cigarette she,4239.88,3.69,4241.725
been smoking leaving traces that only,4241.59,3.779,4243.4795
Martin had been their choices that you,4243.57,3.299,4245.2195
were bound to discover inspector and,4245.369,2.881,4246.809499999999
what did you hope to achieve then by all,4246.869,2.941,4248.3395
this exactly what did happen,4248.25,4.23,4250.365
I knew this when I turned up my wife,4249.81,3.78,4251.700000000001
would have to deny being infant,4252.48,3.599,4254.2795
inspected Martin and when the body was,4253.59,3.779,4255.4795
discovered she'd have to stick to her,4256.079,4.08,4258.119
story I'm a new inspector found fentons,4257.369,4.681,4259.7095
first letter and Martin's fingerprints,4260.159,3.511,4261.9145
all over the place after he denied,4262.05,3.6,4263.85
having been there well you were bound to,4263.67,3.09,4265.215
wonder what really happened weren't you,4265.65,3.299,4267.2995
undoubtedly of course I was mad with,4266.76,3.629,4268.574500000001
jealousy then trying all I could to hurt,4268.949,6.091,4271.9945
Martin I regret it very much now what,4270.389,5.611,4273.1945000000005
did you do with all the letters you,4275.04,2.309,4276.1945
stuffed into your pockets,4276.0,2.639,4277.3195
I took some away and destroyed them of,4277.349,3.361,4279.029500000001
course then I had to find a way to,4278.639,3.841,4280.5595
connect Martin directly with a fake,4280.71,4.889,4283.1545
murder that wasn't easy,4282.48,4.92,4284.94
if Fenton has shot himself at have been,4285.599,4.98,4288.089
a gun but gasps then I had a really,4287.4,5.009,4289.9045
brilliant idea you know the gas masks,4290.579,4.29,4292.724
like I said to work and made it how,4292.409,3.781,4294.2995
could possibly be use and a strong,4294.869,3.721,4296.7294999999995
healthy man even I can't imagine now if,4296.19,3.659,4298.019499999999
it was found on Martin it and make,4298.59,2.94,4300.06
things even worse for him you mean to,4299.849,2.911,4301.3045
tell me it was never used,4301.53,4.109,4303.5845
of course not I invented it then how do,4302.76,4.08,4304.8
you explain the fact that it was,4305.639,3.781,4307.529500000001
impregnated with gas yes because in my,4306.84,4.68,4309.18
son away I didn't forget to play the,4309.42,4.92,4311.88
guest jet over it very clever indeed mr.,4311.52,4.65,4313.845
Warren and at the risk of appearing a,4314.34,4.08,4316.38
trifle dense myself may I ask how you,4316.17,3.929,4318.1345
planted it in the car of a person you,4318.42,3.87,4320.3550000000005
didn't know quite simple Martin's cows,4320.099,3.75,4321.974
outside my own front door and I returned,4322.29,3.3,4323.94
from fentons flat where exactly did you,4323.849,3.151,4325.4245
put the contrivance in the back,4325.59,2.46,4326.82
right-hand side of the luggage,4327.0,5.94,4329.97
compartment correct so what you're,4328.05,6.81,4331.455
saying is that vented committed suicide,4332.94,4.23,4335.054999999999
and you made it look like murder is that,4334.86,5.15,4337.4349999999995
interesting yes sir,4340.73,4.38,4342.919999999999
yes mr. Warren has a gentleman steal oh,4345.29,43.92,4367.25
sorry - why are you again so soon mr.,4391.07,4.81,4393.474999999999
Warren oh that's all right,4393.18,4.38,4395.37
you've come to arrest an obstruction of,4395.88,3.51,4397.635
withholding evidence or something I,4397.56,3.69,4399.405000000001
suppose no we don't want you,4399.39,3.87,4401.325000000001
we've got Martin surely my confession,4401.25,4.11,4403.305
clears Martin let's just it mr. Warren,4403.26,3.54,4405.030000000001
we don't all together like your,4405.36,3.54,4407.13
confession as you call it in fact we're,4406.8,3.72,4408.66
not inclined to believe it unless you,4408.9,2.79,4410.295
can produce a little more tangible,4410.52,2.25,4411.645
evidence to support it,4411.69,2.76,4413.07
Roger that trouble to invent a story,4412.77,3.99,4414.765
like that well because you were grateful,4414.45,4.08,4416.49
to Martin for getting rid of Fenton so,4416.76,4.02,4418.77
conveniently for you or because your,4418.53,4.19,4420.625
wife asked you to that's all nonsense,4420.78,3.72,4422.639999999999
everything I told you this morning is,4422.72,5.74,4425.59
the truth that's I'm rather dull but,4424.5,5.37,4427.185
frankly I don't believe any man could,4428.46,3.27,4430.095
think as fast as you say you did but I,4429.87,3.0,4431.37
warn you that the evidence I shall give,4431.73,3.09,4433.275
me to bring Barton to trial do you,4432.87,3.99,4434.865
really think you should you're sitting,4434.82,4.32,4436.98
pretty well I save him at the expense of,4436.86,3.9,4438.8099999999995
yourself which I can't see an innocent,4439.14,4.05,4441.165
man hang that isn't what you thought a,4440.76,4.17,4442.845
fortnight ago I would I found out since,4443.19,2.88,4444.629999999999
there was nothing between Martin in my,4444.93,4.17,4447.015
wife your wife told you that she did and,4446.07,5.37,4448.755
I believe her I wish I could believe you,4449.1,5.1,4451.650000000001
sir but I can't what more do you want,4451.44,4.5,4453.69
just something to convince me that your,4454.2,3.6,4456.0
story is true that you really were in,4455.94,3.99,4457.9349999999995
the flat that night I let me think I,4457.8,6.51,4461.055
must have something I know there was a,4459.93,5.73,4462.795
dish stopped over the oven door to keep,4464.31,3.0,4465.81
the gas in oh come now so that's the,4465.66,2.64,4466.98
sort of thing you could have read in the,4467.31,3.44,4469.030000000001
news of the world any time wait a minute,4468.3,4.379,4470.489500000001
the kitchen,4470.75,4.159,4472.8295
some don't knock the milk over there was,4472.679,4.571,4474.9645
a pool of milk on the floor is that,4474.909,4.401,4477.1095
enough for you hmm,4477.25,3.989,4479.2445
you know it almost looks as though you,4479.31,3.639,4481.1295
really were in fentons flat that night,4481.239,4.141,4483.309499999999
of course I was but I still don't think,4482.949,4.831,4485.3645
your story is true now you'll be,4485.38,4.83,4487.795
insulting I hope no sir I don't mean to,4487.78,5.1,4490.33
be you know sir I learned a great deal,4490.21,5.13,4492.775
about art on the case once it seems that,4492.88,4.62,4495.1900000000005
every artist has a certain style and,4495.34,3.72,4497.2
often it's not necessary for an expert,4497.5,3.75,4499.375
to see the signature on a picture he can,4499.06,5.15,4501.635
recognize the artist from the style,4501.25,4.83,4503.665
what's that got to do with me,4504.21,4.54,4506.4800000000005
just this sir your alibi for Martin is,4506.08,5.22,4508.69
too slick if he told me your story I'd,4508.75,3.69,4510.595
have been more inclined to believe it,4511.3,3.689,4513.1445
you see it has the same style about it,4512.44,14.009,4519.4445
as the murder good afternoon sir good,4514.989,15.391,4522.684499999999
afternoon what can I do for you,4526.449,5.551,4529.224499999999
well as a matter of fact I've come to,4530.38,3.6,4532.18
ask your help I can't believe you need,4532.0,2.58,4533.29
two heads are better than one you know,4534.58,5.25,4537.205
miss your husband's idea really yes he,4535.9,5.16,4538.48
came to see me today and told me an,4539.83,3.78,4541.72
extraordinary story he said that Fenton,4541.06,4.65,4543.385
really committed suicide but because,4543.61,4.2,4545.71
your husband was jealous of Martin he,4545.71,3.66,4547.54
arranged things to look as though Fenton,4547.81,4.02,4549.820000000001
had been murdered by Martin I know you,4549.37,4.38,4551.5599999999995
tell me all about it I said you ought to,4551.83,3.329,4553.4945
go straight to you I'm afraid it won't,4553.75,3.33,4555.415
work you know I don't know what you mean,4555.159,3.931,4557.1245
it's quite clear surely I don't believe,4557.08,3.42,4558.79
your story and I'm not going to release,4559.09,4.62,4561.400000000001
Martin well if that's your attitude I,4560.5,5.19,4563.095
don't know what I can do about it you,4563.71,3.36,4565.39
could persuade your husband to confess,4565.69,3.33,4567.355
that he murdered Fenton what makes you,4567.07,3.66,4568.9
think my husband killed him everything,4569.02,6.06,4572.05
points to it you must be joking no no if,4570.73,5.37,4573.415
you would have asked me at this moment,4575.08,2.579,4576.3695
who murdered Fenton I should have to say,4576.1,3.99,4578.095
mr. Warren but I can't prove it he's,4577.659,5.31,4580.313999999999
been too clever for us so far but I can,4580.09,5.52,4582.85
prove it against Martin so either you've,4582.969,4.5,4585.219
got to help me or I've got to go ahead,4585.61,3.78,4587.5
and hang a man who's probably innocent I,4587.469,3.75,4589.344
think you better go what are you,4589.39,3.48,4591.13
suggesting is insulting and ridiculous,4591.219,6.721,4594.5795
very well look mrs. Warren when Martin,4592.87,6.39,4596.065
comes off a trial you'll be called as a,4597.94,3.27,4599.575
witness there'll be a lot of dirty linen,4599.26,3.99,4601.255
washed in public but if your husband,4601.21,4.06,4603.24
confesses we shan't have to call you,4603.25,4.78,4605.64
you'll make a very attractive Widow to,4605.27,3.9,4607.22
put it bluntly don't you think it's a,4608.03,2.4,4609.23
question of which of the two you prefer,4609.17,3.36,4610.85
your husband or mr. Martin how dare you,4610.43,5.72,4613.29
of course I prefer my husband,4612.53,3.62,4614.34

we're late enough already they've closed,136.34,4.0,138.34
the doors it's a medical school lecture,138.42,3.48,140.16
I want to see what the attraction is the,140.34,3.24,141.96
psychology of crimes we'll have the,141.9,3.419,143.6095
psychology of crime come on I have a,143.58,5.48,146.32000000000002
good mind to stay who's the lecturer,145.319,3.741,147.18949999999998
I'd say about you he only letters once a,150.2,7.44,153.92
week now he's about to say,153.36,4.28,155.5
up to this point in the present series,162.98,4.72,165.34
of lectures we've dealt exclusively with,165.18,5.22,167.79000000000002
abnormal mentality,167.7,4.679,170.03949999999998
I emphasize the fact that in civilized,170.4,4.74,172.77
communities 80 of our murderers and,172.379,5.22,174.989
violent criminals were those whose Minds,175.14,4.679,177.47949999999997
have been conditioned by exceptional,177.599,6.42,180.809
nervous stress and unhealthy environment,179.819,6.78,183.20899999999997
last Friday we dealt with the smaller,184.019,5.701,186.86950000000002
group of strictly moronic criminals,186.599,4.86,189.029
and now we come to that much more,189.72,5.879,192.6595
interesting phenomenon the same Criminal,191.459,6.36,194.639
the man who was prepared to pursue his,195.599,3.841,197.5195
own ethical convictions even to the,197.819,3.361,199.49949999999998
point of murder,199.44,4.5,201.69
the Nano's punishment is apt to wear,201.18,5.4,203.88
heavily on the conscious of society,203.94,4.62,206.25
because his actions as likely as not,206.58,3.9,208.53
have been inspired by Justice gretton,208.56,3.84,210.48
Integrity as those of The Men Who sit in,210.48,3.479,212.21949999999998
at worst is an irresponsible opportunist,213.959,5.521,216.7195
at the best,217.62,3.539,219.3895
he's a man with a strong sense of,219.48,3.179,221.06949999999998
even a Mystic,222.659,5.16,225.239
I propose to relate the case history of,225.78,4.14,227.85
a matter of this class and perfectly,227.819,5.461,230.5495
sane valuable member of society,229.92,6.48,233.16
you better give him a fictitious name uh,233.28,5.16,235.86
he gives an old Victorious names all the,236.4,3.839,238.3195
characters in this case,238.44,5.64,241.26
he was a surgeon they'd call him Mr Mr,240.239,4.86,242.669
Mr Michael Joyce,245.099,3.661,246.9295
he was well thought of in the medical,247.44,2.939,248.9095
profession and had a heart of his own in,248.76,3.24,250.38
Harley Street,250.379,4.14,252.44899999999998
his marriage had been an unhappy one,252.0,4.079,254.0395
and he'd lived apart from his wife for,254.519,2.761,255.89950000000002
several years,256.079,3.361,257.7595
consequently he threw all his energy and,257.28,4.32,259.44
interest into his work,259.44,4.259,261.5695
as a brain specialist he operated in,261.6,4.26,263.73
three London hospitals and had developed,263.699,3.661,265.5295
a technique which considerably reduced,265.86,4.02,267.87
the mortality rate in this field,267.36,4.02,269.37
he was reserved in his personal,269.88,4.56,272.15999999999997
relationships and had no close friends,271.38,5.22,273.99
his only relaxation was still suited him,274.44,4.08,276.48
and play the piano or go to an,276.6,4.02,278.61
occasional concert,278.52,4.14,280.59
otherwise it was a live devoted solar to,280.62,3.0,282.12
a life that by normal standards was,283.62,4.32,285.78000000000003
unauthably lonely and empty,285.36,4.14,287.43
but he never recognized this himself,287.94,5.039,290.4595
until he met a woman called Emma Wright,289.5,5.16,292.08
when she first came into his Consulting,292.979,4.081,295.0195
room he hardly even noticed her,294.66,3.96,296.64000000000004
she was just an ordinary middle class,297.06,3.0,298.56
woman who happened to have a daughter,298.62,3.359,300.2995
who was going blind,300.06,3.66,301.89
and let's have a look at this head of,303.72,3.96,305.70000000000005
I gather it was an emergency operation,307.68,4.739,310.0495
after narrow it yes now there are,309.54,4.26,311.67
satisfactory,312.419,2.701,313.7695
the eye specialist said there was,313.8,3.06,315.33
nothing he could do,315.12,3.6,316.92
can you see one enough to read not,316.86,2.94,318.33000000000004
I have the eye specialist report,319.8,6.48,323.04
early optic atrophy,323.28,4.74,325.65
there's a fellow serious condition Mrs,326.28,3.78,328.16999999999996
Wright thing for us to do is to take her,328.02,4.5,330.27
into Hospital make us our investigation,330.06,5.1,332.61
so as to establish the exact cause you,332.52,4.44,334.74
wouldn't mind that end would you,335.16,5.039,337.6795
would you will it hurt no we'll take,336.96,5.1,339.51
good care of you you wanted to go in,340.199,4.621,342.5095
right away I think she should,342.06,5.16,344.64
and come over here,344.82,4.62,347.13
we don't want the entropy to become too,349.44,4.199,351.5395
far advanced,351.06,4.079,353.0995
just gonna look into your eyes you've,353.639,2.521,354.8995
seen those two figures on the magic,355.139,3.301,356.78950000000003
piece keep your eye on them,356.16,4.2,358.26000000000005
my face will get in between but then,358.44,3.72,360.3
look at me,360.36,3.48,362.1
the personality of the child's mother,362.16,3.9,364.11
remain for the time being a matter of no,363.84,3.96,365.82
great importance,366.06,3.479,367.7995
but after the child had been submitted,367.8,4.26,369.93
to a series of tests an x-rays had,369.539,4.081,371.5795
proved that her trouble was due to a,372.06,3.54,373.83
small foreign body lodged anteriorly to,373.62,3.359,375.2995
the optic chiasma,375.6,3.18,377.19
it became obvious that a fairly serious,376.979,3.541,378.7495
operation was necessary,378.78,3.3,380.42999999999995
and the relationship between these two,380.52,4.86,382.95
became inevitably less remote,382.08,6.059,385.10949999999997
will it be very dangerous,385.38,5.12,387.94
how great a risk,392.46,3.66,394.28999999999996
mortality rate for this operation is one,394.08,4.22,396.19
the girl blind,400.38,2.72,401.74
with only my husband were here he'd know,405.0,4.02,407.01
what to do,407.22,3.539,408.9895
without him you might consider putting,409.02,3.0,410.52
it up for a short time if he's coming,410.759,2.461,411.9895
not for several months I'm afraid I,413.22,4.14,415.29
guess I shouldn't advise it,415.44,3.539,417.2095
every week that we let it go I guess,417.36,5.04,419.88
progressively worse I know,418.979,5.94,421.949
I know you're right but,422.4,4.98,424.89
you don't think she,424.919,4.56,427.19899999999996
I mean she couldn't be among the one,427.38,4.14,429.45
percent no man there's no question at,429.479,2.761,430.85949999999997
I've met this problem before on many,432.24,4.2,434.34000000000003
occasions always was complete success,433.919,4.741,436.2895
I wish you felt you could trust me it,436.44,4.58,438.73
isn't that,438.66,2.36,439.84000000000003
well I suggest we leave Anne here at the,443.759,3.06,445.289
she's comfortable,446.819,3.181,448.40950000000004
and I'll operate as soon as it can be,448.44,2.699,449.7895
all right all right,451.139,4.741,453.5095
there's nothing to it Dan,453.9,3.239,455.5195
let me give you something nice to make,455.88,2.759,457.2595
you go to sleep when you wake up again,457.139,3.18,458.729
it's all over,458.639,3.12,460.199
and you'll be able to see properly again,460.319,3.78,462.209
oh Mommy they want to cut my hair off,461.759,5.16,464.339
but darling it'll grow again oh must I,464.099,4.681,466.4395
stay here Mommy Mr Joyce will take great,466.919,5.041,469.4395
care of you oh don't go please Mommy,468.78,4.38,470.96999999999997
how would you like your mother to stay,471.96,2.94,473.43
with you till you go to sleep can't you,473.16,3.479,474.89950000000005
stay with me until I wake up again,474.9,3.06,476.42999999999995
she's gonna stay with you all the time,476.639,4.861,479.0695
if she likes oh yes please Mommy,477.96,7.459,481.68949999999995
he says you can all right darling,481.5,3.919,483.4595
confidence,592.7,3.46,594.4300000000001
certain who is about to operate is often,594.24,4.26,596.37
as nervous as a prima donna,596.16,4.26,598.29
this was exaggerated in the present Case,598.5,3.839,600.4195
by the feverish devotion of the child's,600.42,3.0,601.92
invaded itself to Michael Joyce and,603.42,4.38,605.61
robbed him of that cold Detachment which,605.88,4.56,608.16
is a doctor's great strengths,607.8,4.92,610.26
never before he been so acutely aware of,610.44,3.6,612.24
the identity of the piece of human,612.72,3.72,614.58
material he was working on,614.04,3.96,616.02
as he took the scalpel and made the,616.44,3.36,618.12
first incision,618.0,3.48,619.74
and as the sister handed him the artery,619.8,4.159,621.8795
child took the anesthetic easily and the,667.38,3.78,669.27
foreign body was located and,669.899,4.221,672.0095
successfully removed,671.16,2.96,672.64
the chief Safra of course was The,679.019,3.0,680.519
Wretched woman who had been pacing up,680.64,3.72,682.5
and down the waiting room for two hours,682.019,4.141,684.0895
she broke down as soon as Michael Joyce,684.36,3.419,686.0695000000001
came in and made his report,686.16,3.419,687.8695
and only pulled herself together when,687.779,3.421,689.4895
she remembered rather guiltily as a,689.579,3.121,691.1395
promise she'd made to Anne to stay with,691.2,3.78,693.09
her throughout the operation,692.7,3.72,694.5600000000001
she was anxious to get back to her,694.98,4.94,697.45
before she came out of the anesthetic,696.42,3.5,698.17
there was another woman in the room with,700.26,3.42,701.97
her whom she introduced is her,701.94,3.24,703.5600000000001
sister-in-law and this is Catherine,703.68,2.58,704.9699999999999
a rather overdressed young lady who,706.26,3.18,707.85
seemed to have very little interest in,708.12,3.48,709.86
Anne's welfare,709.44,3.899,711.3895
they had to wait some weeks to find out,711.6,3.179,713.1895000000001
whether the operation had actually,713.339,4.62,715.649
succeeded in Saving Anne's eyesight,714.779,4.5,717.029
meanwhile they shared the daily,717.959,4.38,720.149
uncertainties and anxieties,719.279,5.161,721.8595
am I right depended more and more on the,722.339,4.62,724.649
feeling of confidence which he gave her,724.44,4.2,726.5400000000001
and when it became obvious that Anne was,726.959,3.12,728.5189999999999
on her way to recovery as she was,728.64,3.6,730.4399999999999
tremendously grateful to him,730.079,4.021,732.0894999999999
a feeling which Michael Joyce did not,732.24,3.839,734.1595
mistake but he knew that his own,734.1,3.419,735.8095000000001
interest in hair was greater than it,736.079,2.88,737.519
without admitting it to himself he began,738.959,4.021,740.9694999999999
to dread the day when the job will be,741.36,2.7,742.71
the day of the final examination after,744.06,3.959,746.0395
which Anne and her mother were to return,746.459,4.141,748.5295
to their home in the country and at I,748.019,4.081,750.0595
win the pictures last night the first,750.6,5.479,753.3395
time for over a year it was all colored,752.1,3.979,754.0895
I don't suppose we shall see you again,757.68,4.56,759.9599999999999
I hope you will,760.5,4.019,762.5095
I hope so too,762.24,4.38,764.4300000000001
not professionally of course the fans,764.519,4.081,766.5595
come out mummy we're going to the park,766.62,5.1,769.17
shall we goodbye,768.6,6.359,771.7795
are you really going to the park yes why,771.72,5.16,774.3000000000001
do you mind if I go with you of course,774.959,4.161,777.0395
but I want you to tell someone you're,779.519,3.181,781.1095
don't tell them when I get back then,782.7,4.319,784.8595
there can be no mistake about it,784.38,4.44,786.6
you should have said goodbye when that,787.019,3.0,788.519
relationship came to its natural,788.82,3.6,790.62
conclusion but he couldn't bring himself,790.019,3.661,791.8495
she represented all the things that were,793.68,3.24,795.3
so painfully lacking from her life,795.42,3.18,797.01
devoted to textbooks and operating,796.92,3.24,798.54
so simple and unaffected,800.16,6.0,803.16
she told him about Philip her husband,803.339,4.8,805.739
how his work as a geologist had kept him,806.16,3.96,808.14
apart for years at a time,808.139,3.541,809.9095
and now he was going to give it up so,810.12,3.6,811.92
that they could be together,811.68,3.659,813.5095
she told him how they'd helped for more,813.72,2.52,814.98
having only one she'd become all the,816.24,5.46,818.97
more nervous and possessive about Anne,817.8,6.36,820.9799999999999
they went on seeing each other and found,821.7,4.5,823.95
they had the same tastes,824.16,4.32,826.3199999999999
they both like music fell into the habit,826.2,4.68,828.5400000000001
of going to concerts together,828.48,4.2,830.58
sometimes she'd come and play the piano,830.88,4.2,832.98
at his house,832.68,25.81,845.5849999999999
really should have stayed in town only I,877.459,4.24,879.579
hate leaving Anne alone at night I'm,880.139,3.421,881.8495
relying on you to show me the way,881.699,2.88,883.139
yeah you don't know this part of the,883.56,4.399,885.7594999999999
country oh I know the road,884.579,3.38,886.269
wait a minute,888.18,4.44,890.4
and we lost,890.82,4.319,892.9795
are we doing right that's our Chapel no,892.62,4.019,894.6295
Chapel yes you can see it from my,895.139,3.06,896.669
bedroom window draw up when we come to,896.639,3.421,898.3495
it I must show it to you all right there,898.199,3.0,899.699
used to be great directions in the,900.06,3.86,901.9899999999999
family about it,901.199,2.721,902.5595
when the wind's in our Direction you can,916.44,4.139,918.5095
hear them singing I'd rather like it,918.12,5.1,920.67
sounds good to cross and,920.579,3.961,922.5595
I don't know,923.22,3.299,924.8695
it's rather peaceful,924.54,3.96,926.52
some people hate it capable will try and,926.519,3.241,928.1395
get Philip to sell the house that was,928.5,3.12,930.06
before she was married of course,929.76,3.6,931.56
then after she came back here after her,931.62,3.48,933.36
husband was killed she started all over,933.36,2.76,934.74
she says clay always plays out of two,936.12,3.839,938.0395
who's Clay oh God no he plays the organ,937.74,3.36,939.42
okay thinks we ought to get rid of him,941.1,2.94,942.57
because of it why it doesn't affect his,942.3,3.479,944.0395
gardening oh no,944.04,3.539,945.8095
no it's just that Kate thinks that,945.779,3.06,947.309
it's a job he might go into another,947.579,2.341,948.7494999999999
district and then there wouldn't be,948.839,3.18,950.4290000000001
anyone to play the organ it was a kid my,949.92,4.2,952.02
sister-in-law you met her one day at the,952.019,4.26,954.149
hospital did I,954.12,3.779,956.0095
don't you even remember the people you,956.279,2.401,957.4795
I remember the important ones,958.68,5.48,961.42
the ones I want to remember,961.199,2.961,962.6795
that's our house up there,965.339,3.321,966.9995
there's something I've been wanting to,970.92,3.3,972.5699999999999
ask you all evening,972.18,4.14,974.25
yes it's just,974.22,4.34,976.39
are you divorced,976.32,3.92,978.2800000000001
Donna doesn't want to divorce,980.24,5.62,983.05
why'd you ask,984.0,5.399,986.6995
oh no reason I just wondered we ought to,985.86,6.22,988.97
go you must be late,989.399,10.421,994.6095
when Emma came up to London for the day,1000.38,4.019,1002.3895
she made a habit of calling in at,1002.899,3.0,1004.399
Michael's house in Harley Street after,1004.399,3.0,1005.899
the day shopping,1005.899,2.761,1007.2795
and often they'd have dinner together,1007.399,3.86,1009.329
afterwards,1008.66,2.599,1009.9594999999999
hello hello,1017.98,4.18,1020.07
I'm sorry I had to keep you waiting I,1019.959,3.521,1021.7194999999999
got messed up with my appointments this,1022.16,2.759,1023.5395
afternoon it doesn't matter come and,1023.48,3.38,1025.17
the record ends made it's almost sounds,1026.86,4.229,1028.9744999999998
as though she were a real pianist,1029.66,2.01,1030.6650000000002
this is Madam we walk,1033.199,5.041,1035.7195000000002
here come on,1036.98,4.8,1039.38
of course it is quite a professional job,1038.24,6.7,1041.59
that was a mistake she always goes wrong,1045.699,3.22,1047.309
there but we're going to have another,1047.959,3.781,1049.8495
one made without any mistakes,1048.919,5.581,1051.7095000000002
that's slightly sorry,1051.74,5.22,1054.35
she can play it really this is where she,1054.5,4.82,1056.91
goes wrong,1056.96,2.36,1058.14
she used to play very well,1067.94,3.9,1069.89
after the accident of course she had to,1070.28,3.899,1072.2295
play from memory I made her go on,1071.84,4.32,1074.0
practicing,1074.179,5.541,1076.9495000000002
Emma I do love your husband,1076.16,3.56,1077.94
well do you,1082.52,2.779,1083.9095
I don't know how to answer that question,1085.64,5.06,1088.17
but you know why I asked,1087.14,3.56,1088.92
well Michael I don't know what to say,1093.74,4.38,1095.93
Philip and I have been together for so,1096.08,3.18,1097.6699999999998
I love you Emma,1099.26,3.08,1100.8
you shouldn't have told me,1102.5,3.38,1104.19
we kept quiet about it we might have,1105.919,3.541,1107.6895000000002
gone on seeing each other,1107.419,5.0,1109.919
and it wouldn't have worked,1109.46,2.959,1110.9395
I wanted you to know,1115.16,3.259,1116.7895
I did know Michael,1118.64,3.08,1120.18
tried not to recognize it and try to,1125.48,3.84,1127.4
tell myself that something would happen,1128.12,2.88,1129.56
to make it all right,1129.32,3.599,1131.1195
I knew nothing could,1131.0,3.9,1132.95
it could never be all right,1132.919,4.021,1134.9295000000002
neither of us is free or ever likely to,1134.9,3.18,1136.49
there's nothing we can do about it,1138.08,4.02,1140.09
we won't see each other again after,1140.6,3.8,1142.5
oh Michael so shall I,1149.539,5.301,1152.1895
it became more and more difficult for,1178.179,4.061,1180.2095000000002
them to end their Association than,1180.38,3.96,1182.3600000000001
another was happy about it,1182.24,4.2,1184.34
Emma's husband was giving up the work he,1184.34,4.199,1186.4395
liked her to be with that,1186.44,4.5,1188.69
she was torn between her loyalty towards,1188.539,6.421,1191.7495
him and her love Michael Joyce,1190.94,6.06,1193.97
decided to write to her husband and,1194.96,3.9,1196.91
explain what had happened,1197.0,3.32,1198.66
to ask him to release her,1198.86,10.98,1204.35
I can't send it can I,1209.84,4.32,1212.0
no he can't,1211.76,5.1,1214.31
it would be too unfair,1214.16,4.8,1216.5600000000002
okay and I'm thinking of of course yes,1216.86,3.72,1218.7199999999998
well there's your answer,1218.96,4.56,1221.24
certainly wouldn't be fair to her,1220.58,4.86,1223.01
does any one thing for us to do I'm,1223.52,4.34,1225.69
goodbye Michael,1229.52,7.2,1233.12
no don't come near me,1236.72,6.98,1240.21
never see each other again,1240.2,3.5,1241.95
available about Mrs Wright,1284.72,3.38,1286.41
this is right,1288.14,5.3,1290.7900000000002
I remember my little girl,1289.76,3.68,1291.6
what about you who oh this is right she,1304.52,4.86,1306.95
fell out of the window and broke her,1308.12,2.54,1309.3899999999999
it was established at the inquest,1321.62,4.74,1323.9899999999998
that the Fatal fall took place at about,1324.38,4.14,1326.45
six o'clock in the evening,1326.36,3.54,1328.1299999999999
the only other people in the house at,1328.52,3.6,1330.32
the time were the child and,1329.9,4.68,1332.24
and a housemaid who testified that,1332.12,4.26,1334.25
earlier in the afternoon Mrs Catherine,1334.58,4.92,1337.04
Howard had visited the house,1336.38,6.179,1339.4695000000002
did you see Mrs Howard leave yes sir I,1339.5,5.22,1342.11
saw her get into a car and drive away at,1342.559,4.681,1344.8995
about what time well a little before six,1344.72,4.56,1347.0
I should say sir and it was some minutes,1347.24,4.02,1349.25
later that you heard a noise as of,1349.28,3.96,1351.26
someone falling yes,1351.26,5.899,1354.2095
that will be all respond thank you,1353.24,3.919,1355.1995
repeat after me I swear by almighty God,1364.64,4.62,1366.95
I swear by almighty God and I will speak,1367.58,3.24,1369.1999999999998
the truth but I will speak the truth the,1369.26,2.94,1370.73
whole truth the whole truth and nothing,1370.82,3.479,1372.5594999999998
but the truth about the truth you are,1372.2,5.04,1374.72
Mrs Catherine Hart yes your address is I,1374.299,5.461,1377.0294999999999
live at the Arcadia Hotel yes,1377.24,4.439,1379.4595
and what was your relationship to the,1379.76,3.659,1381.5895
deceased she was my sister-in-law she,1381.679,4.081,1383.7195000000002
was married to my brother Philip when,1383.419,4.981,1385.9095000000002
did you last see Mrs Wright alive about,1385.76,4.14,1387.83
six o'clock on the evening of the,1388.4,3.0,1389.9
accident I was with her for about an,1389.9,4.5,1392.15
hour you had an engagement with her,1391.4,5.279,1394.0395
well not exactly an engagement,1394.4,4.68,1396.74
she knew that I might stop by,1396.679,4.441,1398.8995
what's she actually expecting you to,1399.08,4.5,1401.33
stop by well she wasn't exactly,1401.12,5.039,1403.6395
expecting me but since my husband was,1403.58,4.02,1405.59
killed I've been in the habit of popping,1406.159,3.241,1407.7795
in and out whenever I was nearby what,1407.6,3.78,1409.49
happened when you arrived,1409.4,3.36,1411.0800000000002
did you talk yes we chatted for a while,1412.76,5.22,1415.37
about anything in particular,1415.64,4.38,1417.8300000000002
no just talk,1417.98,5.34,1420.65
did you seem worried on the contrary she,1420.02,4.32,1422.18
was very cheerful she was looking,1423.32,3.239,1424.9395
forward to her husband coming home,1424.34,4.14,1426.4099999999999
had she been suffering from ill health,1426.559,3.6,1428.359
not at all,1428.48,3.36,1430.16
then there was nothing in her manner to,1430.159,2.941,1431.6295
suggest that anything was wrong,1431.84,2.64,1433.1599999999999
certainly not,1433.1,2.939,1434.5694999999998
oh but she did have a great fear of,1434.48,2.46,1435.71
she had a great feel,1436.94,4.02,1438.95
do you mean that you mentioned it on,1439.4,3.6,1441.2
this particular afternoon,1440.96,3.66,1442.79
why did you mention it just now,1444.62,3.78,1446.51
but it seemed to me the only possible,1446.78,3.06,1448.31
explanation for her falling out of the,1448.4,4.139,1450.4695000000002
window I see,1449.84,4.8,1452.24
what was Mrs Wright doing when you left,1452.539,3.061,1454.0695

come over here by me,1475.88,3.2,1477.48
oh and you understand what is meant by,1482.659,6.121,1485.7195000000002
telling the truth don't you,1485.659,4.681,1487.9995000000001
it's very important that you do because,1488.78,3.24,1490.3999999999999
I'm going to ask you a few questions and,1490.34,4.319,1492.4995
I want you to answer them truthfully,1492.02,4.98,1494.51

I went to say good night and did you say,1509.24,4.14,1511.31
good night,1512.24,2.88,1513.68
did your mother seem normal,1515.12,4.22,1517.2299999999998
for me and was there anyone with your,1522.14,4.82,1524.5500000000002
nothing happened that seemed unusual to,1534.679,3.781,1536.5695
thank you that will be all,1538.46,3.74,1540.33
right repeat after me I swear by,1548.6,4.079,1550.6395
almighty God I swear by almighty God but,1550.76,3.36,1552.44

her mother died Philip will never want,1943.399,3.061,1944.9295
to see the place again it's empty now,1944.779,4.081,1946.8195

all right same place six o'clock in the,1972.26,6.539,1975.5295
bar wonderful good good night,1975.799,5.541,1978.5695
good night,1978.799,2.541,1980.0695
you decided to visit Emma's empty house,1989.799,6.1,1992.849
you've never been inside her home,1993.86,4.319,1996.0194999999999
and he felt that if he could see it,1995.899,4.681,1998.2395
imagine somewhere find an answer to the,1998.179,5.36,2000.8590000000002
problem of Emma's death,2000.58,2.959,2002.0594999999998
he looked around the ground and tried to,2004.12,4.62,2006.4299999999998
find some way of getting into the house,2006.279,4.321,2008.4395
there were no windows unlatched and the,2008.74,3.539,2010.5095000000001
place seemed to be completely deserted,2010.6,4.64,2012.9199999999998
so he had to break in,2012.279,2.961,2013.7595
this was the room where Emma had spent,2092.139,3.72,2093.9990000000003
her Leisure Hours,2094.179,3.301,2095.8295000000003
everything was just as it must have been,2095.859,4.021,2097.8695
when she was alive,2097.48,4.32,2099.64
happy Anna,2099.88,4.82,2102.29
as soon as he opened the door,2139.079,4.78,2141.469
there was still the faint smell of her,2142.18,4.28,2144.3199999999997
he could see the little chapel that,2159.24,5.52,2162.0
Emmett found so Charming,2161.44,3.32,2163.1
that's what I should be asking you,2265.42,5.22,2268.03
I didn't know there was anyone here no,2268.3,3.66,2270.13
doubt you didn't,2270.64,2.939,2272.1095
but that's no excuse for breaking into,2271.96,3.06,2273.4900000000002
other people's houses in the middle of,2273.579,4.081,2275.6195000000002
the night you can be add up for this yes,2275.02,4.319,2277.1795
I suppose I can,2277.66,3.78,2279.5499999999997
you looking after this please I'm the,2279.339,3.24,2280.959
did you take anything that doesn't,2282.579,4.201,2284.6795
belong to you no certainly not it's,2283.72,4.68,2286.06
rather difficult to explain now it's,2286.78,3.36,2288.46
just that you haven't got the piano of,2288.4,3.9,2290.35
your own I suppose,2290.14,4.86,2292.5699999999997
it's all right I believe you no sensible,2292.3,4.2,2294.4
burglar is going to stop flexing the,2295.0,4.26,2297.13
piano while he's on the job,2296.5,4.2,2298.6
did you know the lady who owned this,2299.26,3.839,2301.1795
house Noah well I worked for her for 10,2300.7,5.22,2303.31
years I looked after the garden oh,2303.099,4.441,2305.3195
you're the guardman who plays the organ,2305.92,3.84,2307.84
at the chapel huh,2307.54,5.36,2310.22
do you know about me,2309.76,3.14,2311.3300000000004
look here there's no point in our,2313.3,3.12,2314.86
standing out here in the cold I've got,2314.92,2.82,2316.33
the kettle on would you like a cup of,2316.42,2.46,2317.65
tea there's nothing I'd like business,2317.74,4.099,2319.7895
come down to my room,2318.88,2.959,2320.3595
I gather that Mrs Howard didn't take,2321.88,4.56,2324.1600000000003
very kind to your organ played poking,2323.68,4.32,2325.8399999999997
the nose into everyone's business let,2326.44,3.419,2328.1495
the poor lady a nice dance I can tell,2328.0,4.8,2330.4
you shocking tragedy that was such a,2329.859,5.701,2332.7095
nice lady I'm usually in bed by this,2332.8,4.92,2335.26
time I broke me an earlier I might have,2335.56,4.14,2337.63
played the piano in peace if you picked,2337.72,2.76,2339.1
the right knife you could have made,2339.7,2.399,2340.8995
yourself at home the whole evening oh,2340.48,4.2,2342.58
really yes I always cycle over to my,2342.099,4.561,2344.3795
sisters on Fridays kind of breaks the,2344.68,3.8,2346.58
monotony thanks for the information,2346.66,3.98,2348.6499999999996
however a bird you know I could use it,2348.48,5.619,2351.2895
you're no burglar I can see that,2350.64,6.4,2353.8399999999997
I knew Mrs Right I wanted to have a look,2354.099,5.24,2356.719
at the scene of the accident,2357.04,5.46,2359.77
it were no accident a coroner said it,2359.339,5.561,2362.1195
was and what if he did,2362.5,4.38,2364.69
does it seem likely to you that a lady,2364.9,3.54,2366.67
would fall out of a window she'd be,2366.88,3.66,2368.71
looking after for 10 years,2368.44,4.62,2370.75
a lady that was perfectly healthy and,2370.54,4.559,2372.8195
didn't suffer from a fear of heights no,2373.06,3.6,2374.86
matter what some people said at the,2375.099,3.901,2377.0495
inquest help yourself to milk thank you,2376.66,5.28,2379.2999999999997
she's a real devil at this is hard,2379.0,5.16,2381.58
it's in Prejudice which not only me,2381.94,4.74,2384.31
Doris would bear me out sugar no thank,2384.16,5.16,2386.74
you and Coke this is how I'd lived here,2386.68,4.38,2388.87
for a time after a husband was killed,2389.32,3.74,2391.19
and she'd never let Mrs ride alone,2391.06,4.559,2393.3395
always snagging and getting on her,2393.06,3.58,2394.85
and Mrs Wright was that soft-hearted she,2396.64,4.02,2398.65
was very easily upset,2398.859,4.561,2401.1394999999998
yes I know she was and then there was a,2400.66,4.32,2402.8199999999997
scene about the carpet,2403.42,4.08,2405.46
what about the cupboard oh she's telling,2404.98,5.16,2407.56
me she said I did stole the carpet Mrs,2407.5,4.02,2409.51
Right the time she gave it to her just,2410.14,3.479,2411.8795
to save Mrs hard's face but we now,2411.52,4.8,2413.92
different they say Mrs hard got to tidy,2413.619,5.161,2416.1995
Sam for it did she,2416.32,4.56,2418.6000000000004
I imagine Mrs harder said it went off,2418.78,3.9,2420.73
well she had a lot of money by her,2420.88,3.84,2422.8
husband but that didn't stop her trying,2422.68,4.32,2424.8399999999997
to get more have another cat no thank,2424.72,3.24,2426.3399999999997
you very much,2427.0,4.38,2429.19
knowing yes tried to get me the set just,2427.96,6.54,2431.23
because she didn't like my organ plane,2431.38,5.04,2433.9
are you fantasy,2434.5,5.42,2437.21
it's a long time since I've said,2436.42,3.5,2438.17
if you want to know what I think Mrs,2439.96,4.26,2442.09
Howard pushed her I'm sure that's not,2441.64,5.1,2444.19
true she could do it,2444.22,4.5,2446.47
but the maid says they enquist that Mrs,2446.74,3.18,2448.33
hard left the house before it happened,2448.72,3.48,2450.4599999999996
Doris would want to keep it dark for Mr,2449.92,4.86,2452.35
Wright's sake,2452.2,4.74,2454.5699999999997
well for Mrs hard sick I hope you're,2454.78,4.4,2456.98
first he found it hard to credit the,2461.68,4.56,2463.96
caretakers Association but later as he,2463.54,4.74,2465.91
got to know Kate Howie you couldn't,2466.24,4.98,2468.7299999999996
entirely dismiss the idea she was a hard,2468.28,5.46,2471.01
self-centered brittle woman it did seem,2471.22,4.02,2473.23
just possible that she had had something,2473.74,4.28,2475.8799999999997
to do with her sister-in-law's death,2475.24,5.3,2477.89
Howard was delighted with his intentions,2478.02,5.8,2480.92
92 pleased to talk about herself,2480.54,5.86,2483.47
she appeared to be a woman with a grudge,2483.82,4.32,2485.98
first of all when she'd wanted to be a,2486.4,3.179,2487.9895
singer her parents had refused to pay,2488.14,2.82,2489.5499999999997
for her training,2489.579,2.881,2491.0195000000003
her husband had been equally,2490.96,4.26,2493.09
uncooperative from the way she spoke of,2492.46,4.2,2494.56
him one would have thought that he'd,2495.22,3.3,2496.87
chosen to Die Young solely in order to,2496.66,3.84,2498.58
keep her shoulder money,2498.52,4.2,2500.62
then there was her brother Philip,2500.5,4.079,2502.5395
she'd always resented the fact that he,2502.72,3.42,2504.43
had the lounge chair of her family's,2504.579,2.701,2505.9295
there were so many things she would have,2507.28,2.819,2508.6895000000004
liked to do with her life she kept,2508.66,2.52,2509.92
telling him,2510.099,2.76,2511.4790000000003
he tried to draw her out on the subject,2511.18,2.88,2512.62
of Emma right,2512.859,3.781,2514.7495
but here she was much more reticent,2514.06,4.44,2516.2799999999997
however she did finally come out with an,2516.64,4.4,2518.8399999999997
interesting statement Emma had a lava,2518.5,4.8,2520.9
that's not true that surprises you I,2523.3,3.6,2525.1000000000004
how did you know she killed me,2526.9,4.52,2529.1600000000003
to tell you who the man was no I suppose,2531.7,4.02,2533.71
I shouldn't have talked about her now,2534.579,3.301,2536.2295000000004
that she's dead still you asked and now,2535.72,3.359,2537.3995
you know why I say that and I'll be,2537.88,3.239,2539.4995
better off without her where's I'm going,2539.079,5.76,2541.9590000000003
to live with me with you oh don't look,2541.119,6.48,2544.359
so sharp I can't exactly picture you,2544.839,4.981,2547.3295
looking after a child no don't be so,2547.599,4.441,2549.8195
sure of that I'm full of unfulfilled,2549.82,4.98,2552.31
maternal instincts I am,2552.04,5.039,2554.5595
no I've arranged for her to go to,2554.8,3.779,2556.6895000000004
boarding school I didn't expect to hear,2557.079,3.961,2559.0595000000003
of her again until summer holidays can I,2558.579,3.481,2560.3195
sit down over here you're such a long,2561.04,2.88,2562.48
my father satisfied with this,2563.92,2.88,2565.36
Arrangement oh yes he came with me to,2565.24,3.0,2566.74
make a home for her did you of course,2566.8,3.66,2568.63
any at a school making a home now don't,2568.24,3.66,2570.0699999999997
you start from me I've had quite enough,2570.46,2.879,2571.8995
trouble for land she wants to be allowed,2571.9,3.24,2573.52
to stay on with Emma's mother until it,2573.339,2.581,2574.6295
wants to be brought up by someone,2575.14,3.84,2577.06
younger hence me you see when did she,2575.92,5.82,2578.83
start her school Monday I've got her,2578.98,4.02,2580.9900000000002
coming to town tomorrow to get her teeth,2581.74,3.54,2583.5099999999998
fixed before she goes the sickly,2583.0,3.78,2584.89
responsibility said it cannot be helped,2585.28,3.0,2586.78
and presumably our trouble will not go,2586.78,3.9,2588.73
entirely unrewarded oh no but it's,2588.28,3.539,2590.0495
making me not allowance to take care of,2590.68,2.22,2591.79
her I shouldn't have taken it down,2591.819,3.061,2593.3495
otherwise still it's an awful nuisance,2592.9,4.62,2595.21
poor little land it was just simply on,2594.88,3.479,2596.6195000000002
what time is this dentist appointment,2598.359,4.26,2600.489
are you so interested I was just,2600.64,3.24,2602.2599999999998
thinking that you'll be free while she's,2602.619,4.2,2604.719
there so if I were free at the same time,2603.88,4.979,2606.3695000000002
we might meet,2606.819,4.861,2609.2495
that's quite a thought,2608.859,4.5,2611.109
completely unsuspecting when he made an,2611.68,3.36,2613.3599999999997
appointment to meet her fatia to survive,2613.359,3.181,2614.9494999999997
four o'clock,2615.04,3.12,2616.6
you never had any intention of keeping,2616.54,3.0,2618.04
this appointment,2618.16,3.24,2619.7799999999997
he had to see Anne,2619.54,3.36,2621.22
and he had to find a way of seeing her,2621.4,3.74,2623.27
she's having tea somewhere she's going,2631.359,3.901,2633.3095
to pick me up afterwards,2633.339,4.561,2635.6195
if you're waiting here,2635.26,5.18,2637.8500000000004
it's wrong,2637.9,2.54,2639.17
does the dentist give you a bad sound,2653.319,4.5,2655.569
I was told to wait here for Aunt Kate is,2655.599,4.081,2657.6395
it all right I was expecting you your,2657.819,5.461,2660.5495
hair's growing nicely it was awful,2659.68,5.28,2662.3199999999997
I thought it was just a bad time you and,2663.28,4.28,2665.42
I had to talk,2664.96,2.6,2666.26
do you like the idea of going away to,2669.64,3.5,2671.39
do you like your Aunt Kate,2675.339,3.201,2676.9395
yes are you sure about that yes,2679.119,6.421,2682.3295000000003
do trust me,2683.38,3.36,2685.06
not very much,2686.74,4.079,2688.7794999999996
I don't know why you're asking me all,2689.14,3.9,2691.0899999999997
these questions I want to help you,2690.819,3.901,2692.7695
a long time ago you trusted me with,2693.04,3.24,2694.66
something very important,2694.72,3.78,2696.6099999999997
what was that your life and don't you,2696.28,2.94,2697.75
why did you say at the inquest that,2701.68,2.7,2703.0299999999997
there was one with your mother the last,2702.94,4.04,2704.96
time you saw her,2704.38,2.6,2705.6800000000003
because it wasn't that's not true though,2707.74,4.379,2709.9294999999997
is it oh I don't know what you want me,2710.2,3.6,2712.0
to say you're on campus weather wasn't,2712.119,3.421,2713.8295000000003
she oh leave me alone please what,2713.8,2.88,2715.2400000000002
happened between Kate and your mother,2715.54,3.24,2717.16
before the accident it wasn't an,2716.68,4.26,2718.81
accident it was just the same as if I,2718.78,3.839,2720.6995
pushed her you,2720.94,4.32,2723.1
it was my fault how could it be I know,2722.619,3.541,2724.3895
I started to get his mommy I don't care,2726.16,4.02,2728.17
what happens to me anymore I still do,2728.38,4.56,2730.6600000000003
annivers tell me I can't you must it's,2730.18,5.159,2732.7594999999997
important he made me promise not to she,2732.94,3.78,2734.83
said they'll send me to prison if they,2735.339,4.081,2737.3795
find out Kate said that yes what's it,2736.72,4.02,2738.73
now right to say it no one can send you,2739.42,3.3,2741.07
to prison if you tell the truth,2740.74,5.839,2743.6594999999998
what happened Dan you've got to tell me,2742.72,3.859,2744.6495
I went up to Mommy's room to say good,2749.38,3.84,2751.3
I've been playing in the garden since,2753.22,4.139,2755.2895
tea time I knew what cake was with Mommy,2754.96,4.44,2757.18
and as I reached the top of the stairs,2757.359,3.72,2759.219
our cake was coming out of mommy's room,2759.4,4.8,2761.8
she was angry and she talks in a very,2761.079,5.461,2763.8095000000003
quiet voice to me she said she had,2764.2,4.379,2766.3894999999998
something very important to tell me,2766.54,4.559,2768.8195
then she started she said the most,2768.579,4.441,2770.7995
horrible things about her mommy about,2771.099,3.901,2773.0495
Mommy and some men,2773.02,3.36,2774.7
there's going to be a divorce she said,2775.0,3.3,2776.65
and I'd have to go evidence against,2776.38,4.02,2778.3900000000003
I caught up there to see all the awful,2780.4,4.38,2782.59
things mommy had done,2782.5,3.66,2784.33
suppose mommy must have been listening,2784.78,3.42,2786.4900000000002
all the time because suddenly she still,2786.16,4.38,2788.35
don't kick to get out of the house she,2788.2,3.6,2790.0
wouldn't go,2790.54,3.059,2792.0695
mommy told me to come to her room with,2791.8,5.519,2794.5595000000003
her but I wouldn't I don't know why I,2793.599,6.061,2796.6295
was afraid I suppose and I believe God,2797.319,3.961,2799.2995
I believed then it was only afterwards I,2801.28,6.299,2804.4295
saw how Wicked she was,2804.88,4.739,2807.2495
I heard mommy slam the door forever when,2807.579,5.52,2810.3390000000004
she went back I never saw her again it,2809.619,5.041,2812.1395
was all my fault for believing I was,2813.099,2.641,2814.4195
no Anne it wasn't your fault,2815.74,3.44,2817.4599999999996
what in the world happened to you I'm,2822.64,3.42,2824.35
afraid I couldn't make it I can see that,2824.5,3.24,2826.12
where have you been I got held up well,2826.06,2.94,2827.5299999999997
you could have telephone me I waited for,2827.74,2.64,2829.06
you over an hour as it happens I had,2829.0,3.18,2830.59
more important things to do I don't know,2830.38,3.6,2832.1800000000003
who you think you are I'm not the habit,2832.18,4.139,2834.2495
of paying for my own tea,2833.98,5.24,2836.6
come along in,2836.319,2.901,2837.7695
I realized it was very silly of me to be,2946.42,3.78,2948.31
so annoyed with you this afternoon I,2948.339,3.121,2949.8995
suppose you're working you couldn't help,2950.2,4.26,2952.33
it is that what you came to say yes,2951.46,5.22,2954.07
all right I just did it now,2954.46,3.359,2956.1395
good night,2956.68,3.84,2958.6
you're still angry with me please don't,2957.819,5.821,2960.7295
be let's forget about it and be friends,2960.52,5.819,2963.4295
I don't want to see you again Kate oh,2963.64,4.62,2965.95
Michael just because of this afternoon,2966.339,4.081,2968.3795
that has nothing to do with it,2968.26,4.44,2970.48
you can't just drop me like this it,2970.42,4.62,2972.73
isn't fair it'll be better for you if I,2972.7,4.619,2975.0094999999997
do how can you say that,2975.04,4.26,2977.17
you're fond of me aren't you,2977.319,4.861,2979.7495
anyway I'm very fond of you go home kid,2979.3,4.74,2981.67
it's silly to punish his birth just,2982.18,5.0,2984.68
because you're angry with me,2984.04,3.14,2985.61
I'm not just trying to end things with,2989.44,4.08,2991.48
me out of a misplaced chivalry are you,2991.0,5.04,2993.52
misplaced chivalry what do you mean just,2993.52,3.9,2995.47
occurred to me that you might think you,2996.04,3.48,2997.7799999999997
were being unfair to go on knowing that,2997.42,4.64,2999.7400000000002
you're not free,2999.52,2.54,3000.79
you mean I'm trying to drop your eyes,3003.42,3.179,3005.0095
and involve you with a married man is,3004.92,4.38,3007.11
that it well isn't it,3006.599,5.76,3009.4790000000003
I'm asking you for the last time,3009.3,4.86,3011.73
go home before it's too late,3012.359,4.401,3014.5595
I don't care about a lot of silly,3022.74,3.119,3024.2994999999996
conventions,3024.54,2.94,3026.0099999999998
I want to be with you under any,3025.859,4.22,3027.969
circumstances,3027.48,2.599,3028.7795
to your kid,3031.98,2.9,3033.43
all right well you shall be,3035.88,3.26,3037.51
she had made up his mind for him that,3044.72,5.7,3047.5699999999997
was the end for Kate,3048.3,4.62,3050.61
he now began to make his plans for the,3050.42,5.159,3052.9995
Revenge he'd sort of for so long,3052.92,5.159,3055.4995
he arranged for his Junior to take over,3055.579,4.841,3057.9995000000004
his patients and established at the,3058.079,3.54,3059.849
hospital that there was a possibility,3060.42,2.76,3061.8
that he might not be available for the,3061.619,3.48,3063.359
coming fortnight,3063.18,3.6,3064.98
he wanted to be prepared for every,3065.099,3.301,3066.7495000000004
if something should go wrong and prevent,3068.4,3.9,3070.35
him carrying out his plan at once,3070.14,4.28,3072.2799999999997
he didn't want his absence to be noticed,3072.3,4.2,3074.4
he left himself with only one,3074.42,3.76,3076.3
appointment before his meeting with Kate,3076.5,3.599,3078.2995
this was a routine job of an educational,3080.099,4.141,3082.1695
which he did a regular intervals as a,3084.24,4.079,3086.2794999999996
while he was engaged on it,3088.319,4.5,3090.569
his mind was working out the Practical,3090.9,3.54,3092.67
problems which,3092.819,3.54,3094.589
would be involved by this planet,3094.44,4.679,3096.7795
formulated,3096.359,5.7,3099.209
it was a Friday night and it was going,3099.119,5.0,3101.619
to make things easier for him,3102.059,4.381,3104.2495000000004
he'd arranged to pick her up at a lonely,3104.119,4.621,3106.4295
part of the embankment,3106.44,4.8,3108.84
on his suggestion she told her friends,3108.74,4.8,3111.14
that she was going away for a few weeks,3111.24,5.04,3113.7599999999998
as they drove out of lantern,3113.54,5.5,3116.29
she was full of the usual chatter never,3116.28,4.2,3118.38
suspecting for a moment his real,3119.04,4.2,3121.14
feelings towards her until then actually,3120.48,5.4,3123.18
arrived at Emma's house she had no idea,3123.24,5.4,3125.9399999999996
where he was taking her the house was,3125.88,5.4,3128.58
for sale he wanted to see it she,3128.64,5.64,3131.46
accepted this explanation,3131.28,4.68,3133.6200000000003
you knew that no one would answer the,3134.28,3.18,3135.8700000000003
bill because he remembered the gardener,3135.96,3.54,3137.73
telling him that he always went over to,3137.46,4.22,3139.57
his sister's place on Friday nights,3139.5,4.859,3141.9295
the window was still broken as he left,3141.68,5.139,3144.2495
it on his last visit,3144.359,4.641,3146.6794999999997
she followed him upstairs to Emma's room,3146.819,4.861,3149.2495
and over to the window out of whichever,3149.0,4.9,3151.45
had fallen,3151.68,6.02,3154.69
drew the curtains threw open the window,3153.9,6.439,3157.1195000000002
then he told her that he was the man,3157.7,5.8,3160.6
Emma had loved,3160.339,5.081,3162.8795
found out that she was responsible and,3163.5,3.96,3165.48
and now she was going to die the same,3167.46,4.399,3169.6595
way Emma had died,3169.5,5.96,3172.48
he told her to throw herself out,3171.859,8.26,3175.989
at the last moment she started to scream,3175.46,7.56,3179.2400000000002
and she fell,3180.119,2.901,3181.5695
this was a murder conceived in perfect,3185.4,3.6,3187.2000000000003
and faultlessly carried out,3189.0,3.619,3190.8095
I'm afraid I've taken rather longer but,3194.42,3.82,3196.33
the stores than I'd intended I shall,3196.68,2.58,3197.97
have to leave the more General,3198.24,2.52,3199.5
discussion of the subject until next,3199.26,3.599,3201.0595000000003
may I ask you a question,3202.859,3.26,3204.489
yes I take it to the murder I was never,3206.28,4.44,3208.5
the police could find no evidence of the,3212.22,3.0,3213.72
point to do anything other than suicide,3213.9,3.84,3215.82
and yet like all paranoics he had to,3215.22,5.46,3217.95
tell someone about it,3217.74,5.28,3220.3799999999997
I don't quite get that when he told you,3220.68,4.879,3223.1195
presumably,3223.02,2.539,3224.2895
yes he was a patient of mine,3225.66,5.04,3228.18
in a lunatic asylum,3228.119,4.561,3230.3995
yeah he was perfectly same,3230.7,3.96,3232.68
same as I am,3232.68,4.5,3234.93
you didn't mind my asking,3234.66,6.08,3237.7
not at all it was a good question,3237.18,3.56,3238.96
have you been waiting I'll take that,3311.16,4.28,3313.2999999999997
where are we going,3330.599,6.201,3333.6995
you'll see oh a surprise,3332.28,4.52,3334.5400000000004
you went across a red light,3336.9,4.699,3339.2495
do you hate women who make up in public,3347.88,4.56,3350.1600000000003
I've never thought about it,3350.819,3.0,3352.319
so much for that as a subject of,3352.44,2.52,3353.7000000000003
conversation,3353.819,3.601,3355.6195
talk about yourself,3354.96,4.5,3357.21
what was your appointment this evening,3357.42,3.899,3359.3695000000002
I was giving a lecture on criminology,3359.46,4.08,3361.5
well what have you got to say on that,3361.319,4.981,3363.8095
subject I tell the story about a man who,3363.54,5.299,3366.1895
killed a woman,3366.3,2.539,3367.5695
no he was perfectly same,3371.46,3.659,3373.2895
they always have a kink somewhere,3373.26,4.14,3375.3300000000004
there's people who do violent things,3375.119,4.801,3377.5195000000003
like my sister-in-law for example,3377.4,4.62,3379.71
how does she come into the argument she,3379.92,3.36,3381.6
must have been a bit mad to do a thing,3382.02,4.92,3384.48
like that like what committing suicide,3383.28,5.46,3386.01
that makes this address suicide it was,3386.94,2.76,3388.32
an accident,3388.74,2.4,3389.9399999999996
what's the matter,3389.7,2.94,3391.1699999999996
I thought for a moment that was that,3391.14,3.419,3392.8495
awful Chapel near her house,3392.64,4.08,3394.68
we're going to her house,3394.559,3.841,3396.4795000000004
whatever four,3396.72,3.24,3398.3399999999997
you said it was out for sale didn't you,3398.4,2.939,3399.8695000000002
well so it is,3399.96,3.96,3401.94
I might bite,3401.339,4.5,3403.589
well what a time to choose to go look,3403.92,3.3,3405.57
over a house,3405.839,4.641,3408.1594999999998
you must be demented,3407.22,3.26,3408.85
how'd you get it oh do let's come back,3419.66,3.82,3421.5699999999997
in the daytime I want to show you,3421.8,3.84,3423.7200000000003
something it won't take long,3423.48,4.3,3425.63
where are you going I'm looking to see,3435.92,4.419,3438.1295
if any of these windows are up that's,3438.66,3.3,3440.31
not necessary The Gardener should be,3440.339,3.121,3441.8995
here he's taking care of the place till,3441.96,2.32,3443.12
the window broken here,3449.819,5.841,3452.7395
you're not serious,3455.66,6.06,3458.69
certainly I am,3458.24,3.48,3459.9799999999996
oh well anything to oblige a,3463.68,2.57,3464.9649999999997
criminologist,3465.42,4.32,3467.58
a minute will I turn our lights,3469.74,3.379,3471.4294999999997
well which part of the house do you want,3476.24,4.68,3478.58
to see first,3478.44,2.48,3479.68
I better lead the way I know the place,3480.96,4.08,3483.0
I've ever wanted to live,3485.04,3.12,3486.6
I've always loved it perhaps sorry,3486.359,3.24,3487.979
Philip to sell it long ago when he first,3488.16,2.0,3489.16
didn't hear it,3489.599,6.771,3492.9845
that's right,3497.94,5.72,3500.8
how do you know I've been here before,3499.319,4.341,3501.4895
what really gave you the idea,3507.0,5.04,3509.52
that she had a lover,3509.7,5.52,3512.46
she told me so now tell me the truth,3512.04,4.68,3514.38
I overheard them talking on the,3516.72,3.3,3518.37
telephone I listened on the extension,3518.16,5.6,3520.96
didn't you recognize the man's voice,3520.02,3.74,3521.89
no but you do now,3524.64,4.1,3526.69
your evidence I thought you were safe,3533.099,4.2,3535.199
because when she was dead that was the,3535.619,3.601,3537.4195
end of the matter,3537.299,3.421,3539.0095
did you really imagine that I'd accept,3539.22,3.119,3540.7794999999996
her desk without making every effort to,3540.72,4.34,3542.89
find out how it happened,3542.339,5.9,3545.2889999999998
that's where she fell isn't it,3569.359,5.381,3572.0495
I don't know I wasn't here,3572.76,3.48,3574.5
you tried to get money out of her,3574.74,2.4,3575.9399999999996
because you thought she was being,3576.24,2.64,3577.56
unfaithful,3577.14,3.3,3578.79
and when that was no good you poisoned,3578.88,3.959,3580.8595

I'm not quite sure where it is from here,4143.179,3.54,4144.9490000000005
I know this district and perhaps I can,4144.739,3.96,4146.718999999999
help you no I don't think you can it's a,4146.719,2.761,4148.0995
are you London Man,4149.48,4.379,4151.6695
yes have you had any experience with,4151.52,4.86,4153.950000000001
fractured skulls,4153.859,5.281,4156.499500000001
quite a lot oh could have used you,4156.38,4.5,4158.63
tonight why do you have to turn up when,4159.14,3.179,4160.7295
it's too late what could you have used,4160.88,3.0,4162.38
me for this Kitty I was telling you,4162.319,5.281,4164.959500000001
about Road accident was it yes Lolly ran,4163.88,5.7,4166.7300000000005
into a private car on the farm,4167.6,3.48,4169.34
because he was in the back and seemed to,4169.58,3.0,4171.08
have taken most of the bump she's,4171.08,3.06,4172.61
unconscious now and bleeding from cut,4172.58,2.88,4174.0199999999995
over the right ear,4174.14,2.94,4175.610000000001
it's very suggestive of the middle men,4175.46,3.6,4177.26
in jail hemorrhage,4177.08,4.259,4179.2095
she regained Consciousness too yes she,4179.06,4.5,4181.31
did for a Time seemed pretty well that's,4181.339,5.641,4184.1595
what gave me a clue probably right,4183.56,6.179,4186.6495
fog seems to be lifting a bit yes here's,4186.98,3.96,4188.959999999999
the turning,4189.739,2.821,4191.1494999999995
we're almost there,4190.94,4.56,4193.219999999999
well at least I can be in at the death,4192.56,5.58,4195.35
should jump to conclusions,4195.5,4.5,4197.75
I've seen extraordinary coverage from,4198.14,3.42,4199.85
head injuries well I guess we've all,4200.0,3.239,4201.6195
seen extraordinary things happen but I,4201.56,4.02,4203.570000000001
never expect them and I certainly don't,4203.239,4.321,4205.3994999999995
care one way or the other,4205.58,4.2,4207.68
I almost thought I cared very much,4207.56,4.2,4209.660000000001
I never liked losing a patient,4209.78,3.72,4211.639999999999
well that's the sort of sentimentality,4211.76,3.12,4213.320000000001
of get over when you've killed as many,4213.5,3.06,4215.03
patients as I have,4214.88,3.72,4216.74
I don't think so,4216.56,3.659,4218.3895
I've always resented the fact that one,4218.6,3.599,4220.3995
can't choose,4220.219,4.321,4222.3795
can't choose what,4222.199,5.52,4224.959
which patients to kill,4224.54,4.74,4226.91
you and as a doctor you must be in the,4227.719,3.421,4229.4295
constant state of frustration,4229.28,4.02,4231.29
in your case let's say vanity is,4231.14,4.38,4233.33
involved not sentimentality but whatever,4233.3,4.74,4235.67
it is it's just as bad man doesn't have,4235.52,4.56,4237.8
any generous feelings he only thinks he,4238.04,4.199,4240.1395
has selfishness habit and Hard Cash,4240.08,4.68,4242.42
those are just real motives looked out,4242.239,4.141,4244.309499999999
from that angle life can hardly be worth,4244.76,3.78,4246.650000000001
living it doesn't but I've done myself,4246.38,3.66,4248.21
enjoying it,4248.54,3.179,4250.1295
just up here,4250.04,3.36,4251.72
now for another scene with the mother,4251.719,3.661,4253.5495
why did it have to be my daughter and,4253.4,3.0,4254.9
two rounds is that one whether you're a,4256.4,3.66,4258.23
daughter than mine mad I might say if I,4258.62,2.4,4259.82
were honest,4260.06,2.94,4261.530000000001
how old is this girl oh just a child,4261.02,6.78,4264.410000000001
about 12 12. do you any children,4263.0,6.659,4266.3295
oh well I suppose I couldn't persuade,4275.08,4.599,4277.3795
you to look in for a moment and give a,4278.36,3.18,4279.95
little presence to the case it's always,4279.679,3.361,4281.3595000000005
a great comfort of the parent to have a,4281.54,4.5,4283.79
second opinion say there's no hope,4283.04,5.1,4285.59
maybe there is hope,4286.04,5.3,4288.69
he's still alive isn't she,4288.14,3.2,4289.740000000001
is this where they are yeah oh leave it,4295.94,5.34,4298.61
Dr Farrell terrible nature yes isn't it,4299.12,5.72,4301.98
nice mess they made of that cup,4301.28,3.56,4303.0599999999995
oh doctor we thought you'd never get,4309.08,3.36,4310.76
back I uh I managed to get another,4310.58,4.38,4312.7699999999995
opinion this is Dr uh where's the,4312.44,5.94,4315.41
patient oh doctor she still hasn't moved,4314.96,5.6,4317.76
quite right she's bleeding from the,4365.56,4.36,4367.740000000001
middle of meningo,4367.94,5.0,4370.44
would it be all right,4369.92,3.02,4371.43
and operate now,4376.1,3.599,4377.8995
What In This Place we've got a large,4377.96,3.719,4379.8195
saucepan of fish Kettle I want to,4379.699,4.741,4382.0695
sterilize my instruments and uh actually,4381.679,5.04,4384.1990000000005
need some clean sheets,4384.44,5.84,4387.36
I've got my instruments in the car,4386.719,3.561,4388.4995
it's not worth taking a chance she dies,4400.88,4.14,4402.95
during the operation of being inquiry,4403.46,2.82,4404.87
you never know why those things are,4405.02,2.82,4406.43
going to turn out I'm just going to take,4406.28,3.06,4407.8099999999995
a chance if a child's going to die and,4407.84,2.48,4409.08
have enough,4409.34,3.0,4410.84
pretending we can get it to hospital in,4410.32,3.339,4411.9895
that time it's up to us to try and leave,4412.34,4.1,4414.39
the pressure before it happens,4413.659,2.781,4415.0495
well that's a job for a specialist I,4418.54,6.06,4421.57
wouldn't touch it it'll be all right,4421.159,3.441,4422.8795
well it was this way we come out of the,4429.62,3.599,4431.4195
bin we couldn't have been doing more,4432.14,2.64,4433.46
than eight mile an hour and there's a,4433.219,3.541,4434.9895
grinding noise when we'd edit ah sure,4434.78,3.66,4436.61
that's women drive us all over they,4436.76,3.54,4438.530000000001
never look where they're going she was,4438.44,3.18,4440.03
gazing at the side of the road with,4440.3,2.939,4441.7695
stiff the glance in front of her you,4441.62,3.119,4443.1795
should have swirled all out could we we,4443.239,3.181,4444.8295
never saw until she was on us and then,4444.739,2.94,4446.209
she was going on the wrong side of the,4446.42,2.88,4447.86
road well one of you better come with me,4447.679,5.48,4450.419
and show me what's what all right,4449.3,3.859,4451.2295
I had a clean license,4495.739,3.261,4497.3695
Inspirations feeling,4513.44,4.02,4515.45
have you got the Carmen I don't care yet,4515.6,4.2,4517.700000000001
I've got some in my car a small box in,4517.46,4.82,4519.87
the front pocket,4519.8,2.48,4521.04
I hope so it's your line I suppose,4631.1,5.66,4633.93
she has a good Fighting Chance now it,4637.76,4.08,4639.8
gives you a feeling of elation a feeling,4639.86,4.5,4642.11
of control over people's Destinies you,4641.84,4.92,4644.3
find that certainly not I was trying to,4644.36,4.5,4646.61
assess your reactions a spectacular,4646.76,3.54,4648.530000000001
recovery of course would do my practice,4648.86,3.42,4650.57
of world of good apart from that it's,4650.3,3.419,4652.0095
all one to me whether she recovers or,4652.28,2.459,4653.5095
you expect everyone else to feel like,4654.739,4.021,4656.7495
that not you I'm not speaking of,4656.48,4.259,4658.6095
obsessionals I'm speaking of the normal,4658.76,3.78,4660.650000000001
the perfectly sane,4660.739,4.141,4662.809499999999
let me put it this way the vessel which,4662.54,4.02,4664.55
we normal people use for imbibing,4664.88,4.08,4666.92
experience is a stout austerity model,4666.56,4.44,4668.780000000001
which doesn't crack,4668.96,4.68,4671.3
with others like yourself the glass,4671.0,4.98,4673.49
though of superior design cracks quite,4673.64,3.66,4675.47
easily now,4675.98,3.179,4677.5695
instead of leaving it up turned on a,4677.3,4.26,4679.43
shelf a danger to all,4679.159,5.661,4681.9895
it should be thrown away,4681.56,3.26,4683.1900000000005
I don't accept your diagnosis,4685.699,3.921,4687.6595
doctor dispenses death and healing with,4689.92,4.9,4692.37
blind impartiality he's not supposed to,4692.78,4.14,4694.849999999999
weigh the merits of an individual case,4694.82,4.26,4696.95
and exercise a sense of justice,4696.92,5.239,4699.5395
I resent that,4699.08,3.079,4700.6195
what I did today,4702.199,2.96,4703.678999999999
and you know what I'm talking about,4705.56,4.26,4707.6900000000005
it was a gesture of independence by a,4709.82,3.06,4711.349999999999
sense of justice which years of,4711.5,2.64,4712.82
professional practice have threatened,4712.88,3.92,4714.84
with atrophy,4714.14,2.66,4715.47
today I sat in judgment,4716.9,6.12,4719.96
paranoia my diagnosis was quite correct,4723.02,6.6,4726.320000000001
you are mad,4726.58,6.48,4729.82
who's the owner of that car outside,4729.62,3.44,4731.34
she looks better doesn't she yes her,4755.06,4.86,4757.490000000001
color's good beginning to look very,4757.94,3.0,4759.44
it was wonderful,4760.94,5.42,4763.65
I should never be able to think,4763.219,3.141,4764.7895
where is he,4766.82,4.32,4768.98
I don't know,4769.46,3.96,4771.44
look after she moved Oh we must expect,4771.14,4.8,4773.54
that now that she intends to live,4773.42,5.16,4776.0
are you the owner of that car outside no,4775.94,4.92,4778.4
who does it belong to,4778.58,5.7,4781.43
I don't know why I nearly ran right into,4780.86,5.28,4783.5
it he's parked outside without a real,4784.28,3.12,4785.84
oh is that all,4787.4,3.38,4789.089999999999
I'm going to relate to kiss history,4821.02,4.139,4823.0895
my diagnosis was quite correct you are,4904.179,4.041,4906.1995

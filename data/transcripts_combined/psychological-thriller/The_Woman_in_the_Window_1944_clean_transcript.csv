on the first night of your summer,262.0,2.08,263.04
we're not even going to a burlesque show,264.08,3.92,266.03999999999996

perform about uh,270.88,4.879,273.3195
there i'd only be too happy to watch,272.4,7.359,276.0795
incredible absolutely shameful,275.759,6.321,278.9195
it's outraging tradition well look i'm a,279.759,3.761,281.6395
middle-aged man,282.08,4.399,284.2795
we all are we're three old crocs and,283.52,4.72,285.88
that sort of shenanigan is out for it,286.479,2.801,287.8795
just a minute,288.24,3.04,289.76
i don't know that i like being described,289.28,3.52,291.03999999999996
as an old truck,291.28,3.68,293.11999999999995
no michael he's right i'm afraid and,292.8,3.76,294.68
it's a darn good thing too,294.96,3.519,296.7195
men our age i didn't say that i didn't,296.56,3.359,298.2395
say it was a good thing,298.479,3.761,300.35949999999997
because i don't know that it is all i,299.919,4.241,302.0395

i hate this solidity the stodginess i'm,304.16,3.84,306.08000000000004
beginning to feel,306.639,2.961,308.1195
to me it's the end of the brightness of,308.0,3.84,309.92
life the end of spirit and adventure,309.6,4.72,311.96000000000004
don't talk like that men of our years,311.84,4.4,314.03999999999996
have no business playing around with any,314.32,4.24,316.44
adventure that they can avoid,316.24,3.679,318.0795
we're like athletes who are out of,318.56,3.76,320.44
condition we can't handle that sort of,319.919,3.28,321.55899999999997
thing anymore,322.32,3.599,324.1195
life ends at 40. in the district,323.199,4.481,325.4395
attorney's office we see what happens to,325.919,3.361,327.5995
middle-aged men who try to act like,327.68,3.92,329.64
and i'm not joking when i tell you that,331.6,4.24,333.72
i've seen genuine actual tragedy issuing,333.44,4.24,335.56
directly out of pure carelessness out of,335.84,3.44,337.56
the merest trifles,337.68,4.4,339.88
casual impulse an idol flirtation one,339.28,4.4,341.47999999999996
drink too many,342.08,4.64,344.4
how many is that third isn't it a great,343.68,5.359,346.3595
scout he's lost count already,346.72,4.24,348.84000000000003
he's a strictly two drink man always has,349.039,3.841,350.9595
been for years i'm sorry if i sound,350.96,2.799,352.35949999999997
but trouble starts too from little,353.759,3.121,355.3195
things often from some,355.199,4.161,357.2795
forgotten natural tendency yes when i,356.88,3.84,358.8
have a date for an idol,359.36,4.0,361.36
plantation without a turner but we won't,360.72,4.0,362.72
tomorrow night hey good why don't you,364.72,3.199,366.3195
make it every night,366.96,2.16,368.03999999999996
the three of us unless you've got,367.919,2.961,369.3995
something better to do fine that's a,369.12,2.48,370.36
i think i'll run along with you splendid,371.6,4.0,373.6
maybe lana can dig up for,373.759,4.72,376.119
rita hayworth for you but what about me,375.6,4.08,377.64000000000004
do you think it's quite safe to leave me,378.479,1.521,379.23949999999996
in this somewhat rebellious state of,380.0,3.12,381.56
mind no you'll be all right i'm sure,381.28,3.359,382.9595
just you run along to bed like a good,383.12,3.04,384.64
fella and forget the whole matter,384.639,3.201,386.2395
he's much too old for the sort of thing,386.16,3.52,387.92
we have in mind in me huh,387.84,5.199,390.43949999999995
that'll be good dick i really would like,389.68,5.44,392.40000000000003
to stop worrying you know i don't agree,393.039,3.521,394.79949999999997
with the word you've said,395.12,4.079,397.1595
but the disagreement is purely academic,396.56,4.72,398.92
you know that's exactly my complaint,399.199,4.0,401.199
the flesh is still strong but the spirit,401.28,3.28,402.91999999999996
grows weaker by the hour,403.199,3.601,404.9995
good you know even if the spirit of,404.56,3.44,406.28000000000003
adventure should rise,406.8,3.679,408.6395
up before me impeccable even in the form,408.0,3.12,409.56
of that uh,410.479,2.72,411.839
alluring young woman in the window next,411.12,4.24,413.24
door i'm afraid that all i do is clutch,413.199,3.361,414.8795
my coat a little tight i'm under,415.36,2.72,416.72
something idiotic and run like the devil,416.56,4.4,418.76

you you did pose for it didn't you,619.12,4.56,621.4
well then my admiration for the artist,622.16,3.44,623.88
is done it's not only a good painting,623.68,3.04,625.1999999999999
it's also you,625.6,4.16,627.6800000000001
you know that so quickly i don't know i,626.72,4.48,628.96
only know that if i were a painter and,629.76,2.88,631.2

is it yours no i wish it would,633.839,4.721,636.1995000000001
and i wouldn't have to come over here,637.279,4.081,639.3195
every so often to watch people's faces,638.56,5.68,641.4
is that what you do now and then when,641.36,4.96,643.84
i'm lonely,644.24,6.32,647.4
tonight i was alone i don't like to be,646.32,7.36,650.0
why did you watch my face,650.56,8.16,654.64
oh yes did i react properly and normally,653.68,8.159,657.7595
well there are two general reactions,658.72,6.239,661.8395
one is a kind of solemn stare for the,661.839,5.361,664.5195000000001
and and the other the other is a long,667.2,7.6,671.0
blown whistle what was mine,670.56,6.56,673.8399999999999
i'm not sure but i suspect that in,674.8,3.92,676.76
another moment or two you might have,677.12,2.8,678.52
given a long,678.72,5.04,681.24
low solemn whistle,679.92,3.84,681.8399999999999
well that uh rather embarrasses me well,684.16,3.919,686.1195
it shouldn't,687.04,2.96,688.52
i regard it as an unusually sincere,688.079,3.841,689.9994999999999
compliment because you don't look to me,690.0,4.24,692.12
like a man much given to,691.92,6.96,695.4
me oh no no it's not that exactly but uh,694.24,7.92,698.2
if my admiration was that obvious,698.88,5.36,701.56
i'm afraid you might misunderstand earth,702.16,3.44,703.88
may i help you,704.24,4.24,706.36
could you i'm not married i have no,705.6,4.4,707.8000000000001
designs on you,708.48,4.64,710.8000000000001

a couple of friends tonight and,727.6,3.76,729.48
we discussed your portrait with great,729.12,4.56,731.4
admiration i might say,731.36,3.68,733.2
i'm thinking of their faces tomorrow,733.68,3.44,735.4
night when i tell them about this,735.04,3.599,736.8394999999999
sitting and chatting over a drink with,737.12,3.92,739.08

no no no no it's not that but uh,775.12,5.76,778.0
i was warned against the siren call of,778.32,4.079,780.3595
at my age i should never have stopped to,782.399,3.841,784.3195
talk with you,785.04,3.28,786.68

about it a minute let's see if there is,1230.799,2.081,1231.8395
they'll never believe us you know no i'm,1232.88,3.679,1234.7195000000002
afraid they won't but even if they did,1234.64,3.44,1236.3600000000001
we wouldn't be much better off,1236.559,2.721,1237.9195
they'll say we could make up any kind of,1238.08,4.24,1240.1999999999998
story we wanted to who else saw it,1239.28,4.24,1241.3999999999999
they'll make it some kind of murder i,1242.32,7.52,1246.08
know they will please,1243.52,6.32,1246.68
i have no feeling about him,1255.2,3.28,1256.8400000000001
he's trying to kill me there's no,1259.52,2.88,1260.96
question about that i hadn't killed them,1260.799,2.641,1262.1195
you'd have killed me,1262.4,2.399,1263.5995
if you wouldn't give me the scissors i'd,1263.44,3.359,1265.1195
but whatever they believe i'm ruined,1266.799,6.0,1269.799
my whole life you were thinking of,1270.72,3.6,1272.52
what was it i was wondering if we had,1274.32,4.16,1276.3999999999999
the nerve for something,1276.559,4.801,1278.9595
something pretty dangerous it would shut,1278.48,4.24,1280.6
the door on us completely if we were,1281.36,3.439,1283.0794999999998
anything you say i don't want to go to,1284.799,3.36,1286.479
jail i don't,1286.96,5.36,1289.64
what's this if nobody knows about you,1288.159,7.52,1291.919
if nobody saw him coming in here tonight,1292.32,4.88,1294.76
how could either of us be connected with,1295.679,3.36,1297.3590000000002
it if his body will turn miles and miles,1297.2,3.839,1299.1195
away from here,1299.039,6.481,1302.2795
i'll have to go and get my car,1305.52,3.44,1307.24
i'll park it directly in front of the,1310.48,4.16,1312.56
door and then we'll pick our moment,1311.919,4.161,1313.9995000000001
you'll watch when i carry it out and put,1314.64,3.44,1316.3600000000001
it in the bag,1316.08,3.599,1317.8795
and then i'll dump it somewhere in the,1318.08,4.0,1320.08
country it'll be found of course sooner,1319.679,3.201,1321.2795
or later but,1322.08,2.64,1323.3999999999999
maybe not for a week you mean you'll go,1322.88,5.52,1325.64
for your car while i wait here,1324.72,6.64,1328.04
would you be afraid not of that but if,1328.4,4.159,1330.4795000000001
you got out of here why should you ever,1331.36,3.6,1333.1599999999999
i like you i think you're all right but,1334.96,4.56,1337.24
i don't even know your name,1337.679,2.88,1339.1190000000001
and i don't think there's a man in the,1339.52,2.159,1340.5995
world who wouldn't get out of a mess,1340.559,2.641,1341.8795
like this if he could oh we mustn't,1341.679,2.88,1343.1190000000001
if we do that we're lost both of us,1344.559,6.161,1347.6395
why can't i go with you,1347.679,3.041,1349.1995000000002
well i'm hoping we can get ourselves out,1350.96,5.28,1353.6000000000001
of this completely,1354.48,4.16,1356.56
but there's one condition i won't tell,1356.24,3.76,1358.1200000000001
you my name what i do or,1358.64,2.64,1359.96

you'd know where i live,1361.28,4.08,1363.32
but if we're successful tonight it'll be,1363.28,5.04,1365.8
of no importance to you,1365.36,2.96,1366.84
i tell you what i'll do,1369.6,2.88,1371.04
you leave something here,1372.72,3.12,1374.28

thing that's a little,1471.36,2.16,1472.4399999999998
short of miraculous by the city police,1472.0,3.12,1473.56
as well as the fbi,1473.52,4.88,1475.96

under three quarters of an hour,1483.76,4.0,1485.76
maybe an hour but even if i'm longer,1485.44,3.359,1487.1195

i think we can be pretty confident about,2776.0,3.359,2777.6795
looks easy to you well not exactly easy,2779.359,3.681,2781.1994999999997
but not too tough,2781.76,3.12,2783.32
plenty of clues eh some and the,2783.04,3.44,2784.7599999999998
circumstances add up so far,2784.88,3.12,2786.44
for instance he wasn't killed in the,2786.48,3.359,2788.1595
woods of course you've killed somewhere,2788.0,3.2,2789.6
else in the body taken to the spot where,2789.839,2.161,2790.9195
it was found,2791.2,2.96,2792.68
how do you know that we get the tire,2792.0,3.92,2793.96
marks of a parked car,2794.16,3.28,2795.7999999999997
that's as good as a fingerprint so far,2795.92,3.28,2797.56
as a car is concerned how do you know it,2797.44,3.12,2799.0
was the emergence car,2799.2,2.96,2800.68
footprints in the same soft ground,2800.56,3.12,2802.12
leading from the car back to it,2802.16,2.88,2803.6
deep prince when he was going into the,2803.68,3.28,2805.3199999999997
wood carrying something heavy,2805.04,3.84,2806.96
lighter coming back without his burden,2806.96,4.639,2809.2795
not much question as to that is it,2808.88,5.92,2811.84
no it's good not we've got photographs,2811.599,4.961,2814.0795000000003
and plastic casts of everything,2814.8,3.36,2816.48
while that doesn't help us to name a man,2816.56,3.039,2818.0795
once we've lined up in a suspect,2818.16,3.76,2820.04
there'll be a positive check on him,2819.599,5.441,2822.3195
especially the shoe prince,2821.92,3.12,2823.48
how's that well the print of new shoes,2825.76,4.64,2828.0800000000004
isn't of much use but these were,2829.2,2.32,2830.3599999999997
well-worn shoes,2830.4,2.64,2831.7200000000003
and from the printable worn shoe we can,2831.52,3.599,2833.3195
learn a great deal about the wedder's,2833.04,4.24,2835.16
weight height length of stride any,2835.119,4.0,2837.119
peculiarity of gate he may have,2837.28,4.88,2839.7200000000003
can you tell that from these yes the man,2839.119,5.44,2841.839
weighs in the neighborhood of 160 pounds,2842.16,4.56,2844.44
wears an eight shoe and probably of,2844.559,3.361,2846.2395
moderate circumstances,2846.72,2.72,2848.08
you're rather guessing at that last,2847.92,4.159,2849.9995
aren't you no,2849.44,4.8,2851.84
the shoes have been half sold we've a,2852.079,3.681,2853.9195
number of bits of evidence like that but,2854.24,2.96,2855.72
the trouble with them as you say is they,2855.76,3.839,2857.6795
don't offer leads they only offer checks,2857.2,4.56,2859.48
like the kind of wall you know,2859.599,3.041,2861.1195000000002
yes and his blood the canine inspector,2862.64,5.84,2865.56
jackson found some on a wire fence over,2866.72,3.28,2868.3599999999997
which the body was dropped,2868.48,2.879,2869.9195
he probably scratched his hand lifting,2870.0,3.119,2871.5595
it over yes but uh,2871.359,4.081,2873.3995
traced like that on a barbed wire fence,2873.119,4.96,2875.599
could that be enough uh to be of any use,2875.44,5.44,2878.16
did i say a barbed wire fence didn't you,2878.079,4.961,2880.5595000000003
well the other kind could a man more,2884.319,5.121,2886.8795
naturally scratch his hand on,2885.76,5.68,2888.6000000000004
it was a barbed wire offensive court i,2889.44,3.44,2891.16
was only trying to impress you fellas,2891.44,2.399,2892.6395
with my keeners,2892.88,2.64,2894.2000000000003
can the man get any credit around here,2893.839,4.24,2895.959
at all but in that case i'll,2895.52,5.12,2898.08
give you an opportunity to impress the,2898.079,4.801,2900.4795000000004
whole city,2900.64,5.76,2903.52
does this suggest anything to you,2902.88,3.52,2904.6400000000003
yes it suggests very strongly,2907.52,6.48,2910.7599999999998
that you're eating up with envy you see,2911.76,4.16,2913.84
my name on the front page of every paper,2914.0,3.52,2915.76
so you make a desperate effort to elbow,2915.92,3.439,2917.6395
your way into my case by insinuating,2917.52,3.44,2919.24
that you're the guilty man but it's no,2919.359,2.72,2920.719
use my boy,2920.96,3.28,2922.6

fugly into the bathroom and popping them,3022.16,3.28,3023.7999999999997
into your mouth like,3024.4,5.12,3026.96
salted peanuts poison they're not in the,3025.44,5.6,3028.2400000000002
technical sense,3029.52,4.24,3031.64
it's a dang concentrate too much would,3031.04,5.039,3033.5595
hit the old heart like a sledgehammer,3033.76,5.92,3036.7200000000003
instantly well a matter of 20-30 minutes,3036.079,4.801,3038.4795000000004
bang what's that prescription for,3040.88,3.679,3042.7195
richard it not only kills you if you,3042.96,3.599,3044.7595
take enough of it leaves no trace,3044.559,3.76,3046.4390000000003
just a case of heart disease that's all,3046.559,3.76,3048.4390000000003
they could say i suppose there's no way,3048.319,3.361,3049.9995
of telling how many of your patients,3050.319,4.321,3052.4795
you've disposed of in that way,3051.68,6.639,3054.9995
none whatever's ever get it you said uh,3054.64,6.8,3058.04
they've located the woman not quite,3058.319,4.881,3060.7595
the police theory this afternoon was,3061.44,4.639,3063.7595
this mazda the bachelor had a sweetheart,3063.2,4.32,3065.3599999999997
his business associates are quite sure,3066.079,2.721,3067.4395
of that but who she is or where she,3067.52,2.559,3068.7995
lives they don't know,3068.8,3.44,3070.52
pretty nervous man in romance it seems,3070.079,3.841,3071.9995000000004
any rate when he reached penn station he,3072.24,3.2,3073.8399999999997
went to calling her,3073.92,3.439,3075.6395
either a man was already there or he,3075.44,3.6,3077.2400000000002
came during matthew's visit,3077.359,3.521,3079.1195
and this man the lady preferred over,3079.04,4.079,3081.0795
why do they think that well otherwise if,3083.119,3.521,3084.8795
her true love had been killed she would,3085.359,2.641,3086.6794999999997
have most likely done something to bring,3086.64,3.36,3088.3199999999997
the killer to justice this is just a,3088.0,4.24,3090.12
theory of course i said that,3090.0,4.079,3092.0395
so they fought and mazard was killed,3092.24,3.44,3093.9599999999996
probably with a pair of scissors,3094.079,3.04,3095.599
that's the medical examiner's belief,3095.68,3.679,3097.5195
anyway then in a panic they loaded the,3097.119,3.361,3098.7995
body into a car,3099.359,2.96,3100.839
his or hers and took it to the place,3100.48,3.92,3102.44
where it was found,3102.319,4.961,3104.7995
now these two people this man and this,3104.4,3.76,3106.28
sit hating and fearing each other,3108.16,4.88,3110.6
each wondering how long it'll be before,3111.2,3.84,3113.12
the other is caught and blabs out the,3113.04,3.92,3115.0
whole story,3115.04,6.0,3118.04
always a woman eh wait i'm not through,3116.96,5.879,3119.8995
that i said was the theory this,3121.04,5.76,3123.92
afternoon and what is it now,3122.839,3.961,3124.8195
well now it's anybody's guess something,3128.16,4.64,3130.48
came up just as i left the office that,3131.04,3.44,3132.7599999999998
pulls the rug right out from under that,3132.8,2.48,3134.04
really it seems that mazda's associates,3135.28,4.4,3137.48
always afraid to get into trouble with,3138.319,3.201,3139.9195
his temper it engaged a man a,3139.68,3.76,3141.56
bodyguard to follow him secretly at all,3141.52,3.28,3143.16
was that night too that we don't know,3144.8,5.84,3147.7200000000003
we don't know because he's disappeared,3148.4,4.4,3150.6
as well then there's your murderer,3150.64,5.04,3153.16
isn't it hmm could be but not,3152.8,6.48,3156.04
necessarily then why hasn't he shown up,3155.68,5.679,3158.5195
ah it's not that simple he could have,3159.28,3.6,3161.0800000000004
murdered mazat yes,3161.359,2.881,3162.7995
he might have tried to blackmail him and,3162.88,3.199,3164.4795
kill him in the fight or he might have,3164.24,2.64,3165.56
witnessed the killing,3166.079,1.921,3167.0395000000003
is getting ready to blackmail the,3166.88,2.719,3168.2395
killers but even if he's a hundred,3168.0,2.48,3169.24
percent innocent,3169.599,3.841,3171.5195000000003
he still won't walk in and talk why not,3170.48,4.639,3172.7995
because he's hot he's a known crook with,3173.44,2.96,3174.92
a blackmailing record,3175.119,2.72,3176.4790000000003
that's why he was thrown off the force,3176.4,3.36,3178.08
for shaking people down,3177.839,3.28,3179.479
and he's wanted for at least two other,3179.76,3.599,3181.5595000000003
reps we'll get that gentleman when we,3181.119,4.321,3183.2795

he's tough and strong and i suppose,3190.48,3.119,3192.0395

he get vic has her in the car,3345.2,3.2,3346.7999999999997
well let's go over this layout first,3346.96,2.8,3348.36
then we'll get to her all right,3348.4,2.159,3349.4795
now here is where he parked his car the,3358.559,4.401,3360.7595
tire tracks are gone of course,3360.88,4.08,3362.92
but we have cast and photographs they're,3362.96,3.52,3364.7200000000003
good with 716,3364.96,4.8,3367.36
between 15 and 20 000 miles,3366.48,4.72,3368.84
standard equipment on two or three,3369.76,3.52,3371.5200000000004
popular makeup cars the motorcycle,3371.2,3.599,3372.9995
officer on duty remembers seeing your,3373.28,2.799,3374.6795
cadillac at the traffic,3374.799,3.841,3376.7195
signal that may be worth keeping in mind,3376.079,3.601,3377.8795
did you see who was in it,3378.64,3.12,3380.2
yes the driver a man but he doubts very,3379.68,3.679,3381.5195
much if he could identify him so i don't,3381.76,3.359,3383.4395000000004
think that's going to lead us anywhere,3383.359,3.281,3384.9995
well anyway you got the body here,3385.119,5.44,3387.839
where'd you take it i'll show you,3386.64,5.439,3389.3595
we got cast in the shoes going and,3390.559,3.601,3392.3595
richard what you're going to be the,3394.16,5.04,3396.68
oh am i going right,3400.24,7.68,3404.08
as straight as an arrow professor hey,3404.559,4.641,3406.8795
say you think we'd better look into this,3407.92,3.28,3409.56
mr layla well,3409.2,3.52,3410.96
that's very funny i wasn't even thinking,3411.2,3.119,3412.7594999999997
where i was going i i was just thinking,3412.72,3.2,3414.3199999999997
what the inspector said,3414.319,2.881,3415.7595
that's all right richard don't get,3415.92,3.6,3417.7200000000003
excited we rarely arrest people just for,3417.2,5.28,3419.8399999999997
knowing where the body was,3419.52,2.96,3421.0
i don't imagine our killer was very,3426.319,3.04,3427.839
familiar with this spot because the,3427.839,3.041,3429.3595
fence was too near the road for his,3429.359,2.96,3430.839
at any rate he couldn't go much further,3432.319,3.601,3434.1195
without a great deal of difficulty,3434.079,5.441,3436.7995
so he just dumped it over down there,3435.92,5.12,3438.48
now there isn't anything in particular,3439.52,3.52,3441.28
to see except you want to keep the whole,3441.04,3.6,3442.84
setting in mind,3443.04,3.68,3444.88
he tore his coat probably his sleeve as,3444.64,3.76,3446.52
he lifted it over because we picked up a,3446.72,3.2,3448.3199999999997
couple of shreds of wool and fiber,3448.4,2.56,3449.6800000000003
it couldn't have been from mazda's,3449.92,3.12,3451.48
clothes no different material,3450.96,4.0,3452.96
and we got a sample of blood from this,3453.04,3.759,3454.9195
he certainly didn't pick himself an easy,3456.799,3.921,3458.7595
job magic weight close to 200 pounds you,3458.4,2.8,3459.8
yes it must have been pretty tough going,3461.2,3.84,3463.12
yes especially at night,3463.2,5.28,3465.8399999999997
well yes it may have been at night,3465.04,6.4,3468.24
i suppose so but i was thinking of it as,3468.48,5.599,3471.2795
early morning along about daylight well,3471.44,3.679,3473.2795
i i thought the,3474.079,4.641,3476.3995
paper said night anything else sir,3475.119,5.281,3477.7595
i can't think of anything else you,3478.72,3.2,3480.3199999999997
richard well i,3480.4,4.719,3482.7595
asked me i'm i'm simply bowled over by,3481.92,4.639,3484.2395
the amount of information the police,3485.119,3.041,3486.6395
have got out of such apparently,3486.559,3.361,3488.2395
insignificant details,3488.16,3.76,3490.04
well it's hardly spectacular merely,3489.92,3.84,3491.84
police routine so far,3491.92,3.28,3493.56
but there is one thing we have in our,3493.76,3.039,3495.2795
department that is really worthwhile,3495.2,2.879,3496.6394999999998
what's that patience,3498.079,7.121,3501.6395
imagine so want to see the woman,3501.76,6.0,3504.76
might as well,3505.2,2.56,3506.48
what's that for,3508.72,2.72,3510.08
oh i had one of the men put that there,3512.72,2.56,3514.0
this morning so you wouldn't brush,3514.16,2.639,3515.4795
against that bush,3515.28,4.0,3517.28
it's poison ivy very thoughtful captain,3516.799,4.32,3518.959
well too late to do me any good that's,3519.28,3.44,3521.0
looks as if you'd have a little more,3522.72,4.399,3524.9195
explaining to do richard,3524.0,6.72,3527.36
closing in on me huh,3527.119,5.601,3529.9195
if you'll only confess professor we can,3530.72,4.24,3532.8399999999997
wrap up this whole case before noon,3532.72,4.24,3534.8399999999997

there you go never any consideration for,3538.799,7.04,3542.319

paying him five thousand dollars isn't,4418.719,2.641,4420.0395
getting rid of him,4420.239,4.161,4422.3195

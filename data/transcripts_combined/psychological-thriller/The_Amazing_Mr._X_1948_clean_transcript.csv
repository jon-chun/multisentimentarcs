my chris oh hello chad,118.0,5.28,120.64
explain yourself explain what rooting on,125.28,3.44,127.0
the balcony,127.759,2.72,129.119
just isn't being done this season i,128.72,3.44,130.44
wasn't brooding,130.479,4.641,132.79950000000002
lying to one sisters after season two,132.16,4.96,134.64
strangest thing happened,135.12,3.92,137.08
i thought i heard a man's voice out over,137.12,3.119,138.67950000000002
calling my name next time he calls ask,140.239,4.161,142.3195
him if he has a friend for me,142.64,4.8,145.04
i'm serious how can you be serious,144.4,5.44,147.12
what was the wind are those firehorns,147.44,4.0,149.44
but it sounded like paul,151.44,6.4,154.64
it's been two years now christine i know,158.16,7.92,162.12
but for a moment out over the ocean,162.64,7.36,166.32
i felt very close to him again,166.08,5.2,168.68
used to love the ocean you know,170.0,3.28,171.64
especially at night,171.28,3.76,173.16
he'd go racing down to the beach for a,173.28,4.64,175.6
swim no matter how late it was,175.04,4.559,177.3195
and usually i'd be fool enough to go,177.92,3.76,179.79999999999998
if any husband of mine ever chased me,181.68,3.04,183.20000000000002
into the ocean in the middle of the,183.519,1.761,184.39950000000002
i'd shoot him they did a lot of crazy,185.28,4.319,187.4395
some of them bad but i don't think i,189.599,4.801,191.99949999999998
could ever love another man the way i,192.959,2.64,194.279
chris you've got to stop talking like,195.599,3.601,197.3995
you're getting morbid oh it's not as bad,199.2,5.039,201.71949999999998
as all that breath,202.319,6.081,205.3595
it is bad look at this dress,204.239,5.761,207.11950000000002
i can't wear black when you're going out,208.4,4.96,210.88

well in the morning well yes,213.36,6.72,216.72000000000003
i just happen to like black that's all i,217.2,3.599,218.99949999999998
but just for tonight it isn't exactly,220.799,4.0,222.799
appropriate,223.28,4.879,225.7195
and chris don't wear your wedding ring,224.799,4.72,227.15900000000002

engagement ring on your finger if that's,240.319,2.401,241.5195

into the office at the last minute and i,352.0,5.6,354.8
well no i know it's not serious but i i,354.88,4.48,357.12

well no you see i wanted to show you,361.6,3.039,363.1195

felony court,376.4,2.4,377.59999999999997

i felt you were married i saw your,590.56,3.68,592.4

my husband died two years ago i felt i,613.68,5.44,616.4
could not be wrong i saw him,616.48,7.039,619.9995
dead and his car in flames,619.12,4.399,621.3195
i'm sorry i don't understand how you,624.72,3.119,626.2795

i suppose people do talk do you live,627.839,3.521,629.5995
around here,630.24,4.4,632.44
no i wish i did live on the ocean it is,631.36,3.84,633.28
where i live,635.2,2.48,636.44
alexis psychic consultant,638.72,7.359,642.3995
oh i see you place me in the same,643.36,4.56,645.64
category with fortune tellers,646.079,5.121,648.6395
snake charmers and magicians oh well,647.92,6.08,650.9599999999999
many people do but you must know who i,651.2,3.68,653.0400000000001
how else would you know all these things,654.88,4.88,657.32
perhaps because we are very much alike,657.12,6.64,660.44
you and i free spirits both of us,659.76,7.6,663.56
like my friend here we like the night,663.76,6.24,666.88
and the mist of the ocean the wind,667.36,4.32,669.52
whispers to us and,670.0,5.04,672.52
the sand feels cool under our feet,671.68,5.92,674.64
we're not like i don't know i have his,675.04,3.52,676.8
like martin there's nothing wrong with,678.56,3.2,680.16
of course not if only he would,681.76,3.44,683.48
understand,684.0,3.76,685.88
how little he understands well martin is,685.2,3.6,687.0
logical yes that's why you should marry,688.8,4.88,691.24
even free spirits have to come in out of,694.0,3.279,695.6395
the night sometimes and put on their,695.76,2.56,697.04
pay their bills go to the dentist and of,698.32,5.519,701.0795
course family dinners on sunday,701.04,4.64,703.36
you really shouldn't be so irritated by,703.839,3.68,705.6790000000001
his little mannerisms,705.68,5.2,708.28
like when he clears his throat,707.519,4.88,709.9590000000001
announcing that he's going to kiss you,710.88,3.759,712.7595
any minute or when he counts of all his,712.399,5.841,715.3195
plans in the tips of his fingers,714.639,3.601,716.4395000000001
how i can't tell you how i know these,718.399,4.081,720.4395
but it hardly matters does it since,722.48,7.76,726.36
we're not going to meet again,724.959,10.241,730.0794999999999
chris oh over here martin,730.24,8.64,734.5600000000001
oh hi hello,735.2,3.68,737.0400000000001
i thought you certainly had me scared,743.04,3.039,744.5595
what kept you so long well i was talking,744.48,3.76,746.36
to this man,746.079,5.521,748.8394999999999
well he was here could i have imagined,748.24,4.24,750.36
he was fantastic enough,752.48,6.64,755.8000000000001
well let's get going oh i i tore my,755.839,3.68,757.6790000000001
martin i'll have to go back to the house,759.519,3.12,761.079
we'll go to your house first uh skip the,762.639,6.161,765.7195
theater directly to the blue angel,765.04,3.76,766.92
what's the matter nothing it's it's just,769.68,4.48,771.92
that it's so late and i'm a little upset,772.48,4.24,774.6
could we make it some other night,774.16,5.84,777.0799999999999
of course you sure you understand,776.72,5.359,779.3995
when it concerns you christine there's,780.0,7.839,783.9195
nothing i don't understand,782.079,5.76,784.959
uh here you better take this off my,792.959,3.12,794.5189999999999
hands or i'll have to wear it to the,794.88,2.72,796.24
office tomorrow fix yourself a drink,796.079,2.961,797.5595
i've got to change this torn dress,797.6,4.239,799.7195
martin how flattering i should have,829.199,3.281,830.8394999999999
thought of this in the first place,831.12,3.12,832.68
this is much better than any nightclub,832.48,4.08,834.52
yes and just think no headwaiter,834.24,4.8,836.64
no smoke no people and at the end of the,836.56,3.2,838.16
no check oh martin you think in such,839.76,6.079,842.7995
practical terms i'm a very practical man,842.639,4.64,844.9590000000001
for instance i just said that to make,845.839,3.521,847.5995
you better to do this,849.36,3.039,850.8795
i've been trapped right now if you'll,854.639,4.401,856.8395
just step over here to the sofa by the,857.279,2.321,858.4395
another trap definitely,859.6,12.239,865.7195
darling what's the matter that music,893.36,4.0,895.36
it's just a phonograph but we don't have,895.6,2.4,896.8000000000001
that record,897.36,2.08,898.4
of course you do it was right on top of,898.0,4.0,900.0
the cabinet,899.44,2.56,900.72
that's strange what's the matter chris,902.079,3.601,903.8795
i'm sorry but that was paul's favorite,905.68,3.76,907.56
i've heard him played a hundred times,909.44,3.92,911.4000000000001
right here in this room,910.8,5.44,913.52
turn it off will you,913.36,2.88,914.8000000000001
no i won't,916.48,2.719,917.8395
look darling paul's been gone too long,921.12,5.44,923.84
for you to act like this,924.0,6.24,927.12
i know chris,926.56,6.88,930.0
i'm not saying this for my sake but your,930.24,5.12,932.8
whole life's ahead of you you can't,933.44,5.28,936.08
waste it probing into the past,935.36,6.479,938.5995
if i can't make you forget paul we'll,938.72,5.84,941.64
find someone else who can,941.839,5.44,944.5590000000001
you're right martin i'm sorry i acted,944.56,5.04,947.0799999999999
like a child,947.279,4.48,949.519
would you get me a drink right here,949.6,6.239,952.7195
ready for it,951.759,4.08,953.799
so you think i should go find somebody,957.519,4.32,959.679
um only if it's absolutely necessary but,961.839,5.12,964.399
i've been so out of,965.759,4.721,968.1195
touch with people lately especially men,966.959,4.961,969.4395
what do you expect me to do bring some,970.48,3.76,972.36
around well that would be very nice have,971.92,3.039,973.4395
well you know how hard it is for me to,974.959,3.921,976.9195
meet new people,976.72,5.679,979.5595000000001
i can see i'll just have to propose to,982.399,3.68,984.239
you oh martin i talked you into it and,983.92,3.359,985.5994999999999
you sure did,986.079,3.601,987.8795
and very fortunately for you i just,987.279,6.081,990.3195
happened to have an engagement ring on,989.68,3.68,991.52
martin it's lovely,1001.36,10.479,1006.5995
can't you hear is ocean calling,1065.039,16.261,1073.1695

darling you must have had a nightmare,1262.08,4.24,1264.1999999999998
it's all right now,1264.64,4.8,1267.0400000000002
it's over you're awake and i'm here,1266.32,6.239,1269.4395
janet it wasn't a dream the windows blew,1269.44,3.599,1271.2395000000001
what's so unusual about a window blowing,1273.039,5.12,1275.599
open my engagement ring was gone,1274.88,6.48,1278.1200000000001
the flowers were all with it chris,1278.159,5.52,1280.919
put the picture paul's picture,1286.32,5.52,1289.08
you see just a bad dream i was awake,1294.559,6.961,1298.0394999999999
my wedding gown there in the closet it,1299.6,3.199,1301.1995
came toward me,1301.52,4.32,1303.68
i swear it did,1302.799,3.041,1304.3195
it's just your bathrobe you probably,1307.84,5.12,1310.3999999999999
pulled the door open like this,1310.799,5.441,1313.5194999999999
and it flung out like that,1312.96,3.28,1314.6000000000001
and my wedding dress isn't there how,1316.4,4.399,1318.5995
could it be chris,1318.96,3.44,1320.68
it's been locked in the trunk room for,1320.799,4.0,1322.799
it wasn't a nightmare i tell you i saw,1325.679,3.441,1327.3995
those things,1327.6,3.199,1329.1995
i think it was paul when he doesn't want,1329.12,3.84,1331.04
me to marry got some feeling that is not,1330.799,4.481,1333.0395
loyal to paul if you marry again,1332.96,3.76,1334.8400000000001
it's on your conscience and it makes you,1335.28,4.24,1337.3999999999999
dream why don't you talk it over with an,1336.72,3.68,1338.56
he wouldn't understand think i was,1340.4,5.759,1343.2795
losing my mind nobody would understand,1341.919,7.521,1345.6795000000002
except perhaps alexis alexis,1346.159,7.76,1350.0390000000002
just somebody i once met come on,1349.44,4.479,1351.6795
get to bed,1355.28,2.639,1356.5995
it's after three you haven't got time,1358.88,5.12,1361.44
for any more dreams tonight,1360.799,3.201,1362.3995
janet while you're up would you,1366.96,5.28,1369.6000000000001
get me a glass of water,1372.48,3.36,1374.16
thanks janet,1384.88,4.88,1387.3200000000002
i thought i was supposed to be the baby,1388.159,5.441,1390.8795
in the family here give me that water,1389.76,7.84,1393.68
move over baby,1393.6,4.0,1395.6
night chris night,1399.52,4.32,1401.68
childish isn't it i think the ocean and,1489.52,6.96,1493.0
the fog were more effective,1493.039,3.441,1494.7595
i agree but in my work i deal with many,1496.88,4.72,1499.24
different kinds of minds,1499.76,3.44,1501.48
generally speaking i think you could say,1501.6,3.76,1503.48
that three types of people come here to,1503.2,2.959,1504.6795
the first a fairly large group come here,1506.159,4.64,1508.479
and sometimes a few of them remain to,1510.799,3.441,1512.5194999999999
the seconds have child-like credulous,1514.24,4.96,1516.72
minds they long to believe,1517.12,6.72,1520.4799999999998
they're tired and sad and need comfort,1519.2,8.079,1523.2395000000001
all this helps them it creates,1523.84,6.48,1527.08
an atmosphere you see,1527.279,5.76,1530.159
a mood like music and in it they find a,1530.32,4.8,1532.72
few brief moments of comfort which,1533.039,3.921,1534.9995
helps them to continue with their grey,1535.12,3.919,1537.0794999999998
little lives,1536.96,3.92,1538.92
and so i do not think it is so childish,1539.039,3.681,1540.8795
after all do you,1540.88,5.679,1543.7195000000002
and the third group the third group is,1542.72,4.959,1545.1995
those of us who,1546.559,3.12,1548.119
honestly explore the secrets of the,1547.679,4.401,1549.8795
outer world,1549.679,4.88,1552.1190000000001
i feel that you have come here today to,1552.08,4.56,1554.36
join that group,1554.559,4.72,1556.9189999999999
well i i did want to talk to you about,1556.64,3.12,1558.2
i know he was close to you last night,1559.76,5.36,1562.44
and he's close to you now but wait,1565.52,7.039,1569.0395
maybe i should repel him not bring him,1569.679,4.24,1571.799
why his presence is so strong,1573.919,7.36,1577.5990000000002
it might be dangerous how could paul's,1578.08,6.16,1581.1599999999999
presence possibly be dangerous to me,1581.279,6.241,1584.3995
to your plans you want to get married,1584.24,4.4,1586.44
lead what is termed the normal life,1588.64,6.24,1591.76
but if paul is trying to reach me then i,1592.799,4.48,1595.039
want to help him,1594.88,4.88,1597.3200000000002
have you thought what people will think,1597.279,3.201,1598.8795
martin will think i'm not afraid to,1600.48,5.92,1603.44
think as i choose,1603.52,2.88,1604.96
then christine if you have the courage,1606.799,3.521,1608.5595
and the will to explore,1608.32,5.76,1611.2
i will help you now relax,1610.32,8.64,1614.6399999999999
let your mind be free and receptive,1614.08,4.88,1616.52
janet you do have a tendency to,1625.36,3.679,1627.1995
dramatize and stop treating me like a,1626.96,2.959,1628.4395
i tell you she's been going to see him,1629.919,4.0,1631.919
now do you believe me hmm,1637.279,4.561,1639.5595
she's been reading psychic books too and,1644.48,4.24,1646.6
talking about paul as if he was still,1647.039,3.36,1648.719
gives me the creeps let's go,1650.399,4.64,1652.7189999999998
now what are we gonna do we're gonna get,1653.6,2.88,1655.04
a detective see what he can find out,1655.039,2.161,1656.1195
about this,1656.48,3.84,1658.4
this spook chaser,1657.2,4.959,1659.6795
for 20 years i've been operating among,1660.32,3.359,1661.9995
these phony mediums as a private,1662.159,2.88,1663.5990000000002
and i've yet to find one concrete bit of,1665.039,4.081,1667.0795
evidence of communication with the dead,1667.039,4.64,1669.359
but my sister's absolutely convinced,1669.12,4.48,1671.36
he's told her things he couldn't know,1671.679,3.921,1673.6395
unless he were psychic he's probably,1673.6,3.6,1675.3999999999999
gone to a lot of trouble to investigate,1675.6,2.48,1676.84
they're thorough and clever what i can't,1678.08,3.92,1680.04
understand is christine falling,1680.399,5.121,1682.9595
for such a dribble you'd be amazed at,1682.0,5.279,1684.6395
the people who do,1685.52,3.84,1687.44
not think but there's a millionaire,1687.279,3.12,1688.839
right in this town,1689.36,3.039,1690.8795
wouldn't buy a bag of popcorn without,1690.399,4.481,1692.6395
consulting his medium,1692.399,6.481,1695.6395
what's this one's name alexis,1694.88,4.0,1696.88
it's a new one on me then they change,1699.919,5.681,1702.7595000000001
their names often enough,1702.799,6.081,1705.8395
how about a description there's a,1705.6,7.04,1709.12
picture of him in this pamphlet he wrote,1708.88,3.76,1710.7600000000002
this i used to be a magician,1717.12,8.72,1721.4799999999998
so i got into this right,1720.24,5.6,1723.04
i know all their tricks,1733.679,7.521,1737.4395000000002
it's called a chicago in the case once,1742.24,4.559,1744.5195
young man named meru,1744.72,4.16,1746.8
swindled a society lady out of a whole,1746.799,4.0,1748.799
hat full of money,1748.88,3.6,1750.68
that's alexis he certainly used to look,1750.799,3.681,1752.6395
corny that's alexis we can report him to,1752.48,3.679,1754.3195
the police,1754.48,3.36,1756.16
what charge he served the stretch and,1756.159,3.681,1757.9995000000001
that's that,1757.84,3.439,1759.5594999999998
at least christine will be through with,1759.84,3.52,1761.6
him i mean if we can prove he's a crook,1761.279,4.241,1763.3995
how can we identify him well he could go,1763.36,3.12,1764.9199999999998
out there and try to get his,1765.52,3.279,1767.1595
fingerprints,1766.48,4.4,1768.68
but i think the only times these fakes,1768.799,3.841,1770.7195
are really psychic,1770.88,4.24,1773.0
is when there's a detective around yeah,1772.64,3.2,1774.24
they look in their crystals and see you,1775.84,3.839,1777.7595
coming maybe we could send somebody you,1777.36,2.64,1778.6799999999998
know oh no i i think that,1780.0,15.84,1787.92
your name please harper,1949.519,6.801,1952.9195
this is charles harper not mrs charles,1952.799,11.041,1958.3195
g-hop yes i mean no,1956.32,7.52,1960.08
now concentrate and soon your thoughts,1971.76,5.2,1974.36
will merge with mine,1973.919,7.6,1977.719
perhaps both hands would be better,1976.96,7.92,1980.92
so much better i can feel your,1984.88,6.56,1988.16
vibrations much more clearly now,1987.6,8.4,1991.8
but but your pulse is racing,1991.44,7.76,1995.3200000000002
are you excited nervous,1996.0,5.679,1998.8395
no no but of course this problem is,1999.2,6.4,2002.4
troubling you the question you wrote,2001.679,7.521,2005.4395000000002
comes to me but faintly,2005.6,8.64,2009.9199999999998
almost as though it were false,2009.2,5.04,2011.72
but another question comes through with,2016.48,4.0,2018.48
all the power and strength of,2018.64,5.039,2021.1595000000002
love and truth you are concerned about,2020.48,4.72,2022.84
someone you love,2023.679,5.281,2026.3195
a woman your sister is it your sister,2025.2,7.12,2028.76
yes older than you but still you have a,2028.96,6.88,2032.4
maternal protective feeling about her,2032.32,5.44,2035.04
in many ways you are more mature than,2035.84,3.92,2037.8
golly i'm glad somebody finally realized,2039.76,4.159,2041.8395
of course you didn't always feel that,2043.919,4.561,2046.1995000000002
way once you were jealous of her,2045.6,4.72,2047.9599999999998
you envied her popularity in her pretty,2048.48,4.0,2050.48
clothes and you used to try them on when,2050.32,3.839,2052.2395
she went out,2052.48,3.359,2054.1595
and this suited you because there is an,2054.159,4.321,2056.3195
air of of maturity and sophistication,2055.839,4.401,2058.0395
in many ways especially intellectually,2060.24,4.72,2062.6
you are much older than the many young,2063.2,3.199,2064.7994999999996
men who admire you,2064.96,4.8,2067.36
you know i'd noticed that,2066.399,3.361,2068.0795
does this feel uncomfortable to you i,2069.839,6.24,2072.959
i think i'll have a cigarette,2076.72,3.52,2078.48
mrs harper,2081.76,2.72,2083.1200000000003
mrs harper,2087.599,2.8,2088.9990000000003
it's an attractive case,2119.44,12.399,2125.6395
did you know why i wanted them no,2140.4,6.56,2143.6800000000003
nor do i need to it is enough for me to,2144.56,5.44,2147.2799999999997
know that you wanted them,2146.96,3.04,2148.48
alexis i hope that nothing you've done,2157.119,4.561,2159.3995
to help my sister will get you into,2160.0,3.2,2161.6
trouble with the police,2161.68,3.84,2163.6
i mean if they should investigate you or,2163.2,4.08,2165.24
your past life,2165.52,3.2,2167.12
would they find anything that would make,2167.28,3.559,2169.0595000000003
trouble for you,2168.72,5.6,2171.52
well there are there are many things in,2170.839,5.881,2173.7795
my life of which i'm ashamed,2174.32,6.08,2177.36
but and this may sound strange,2176.72,6.879,2180.1594999999998
the memory that i cherish is a term in,2180.4,4.439,2182.6195000000002
oh there are many brave men who were,2184.839,4.841,2187.2595
imprisoned in their fight for science,2187.599,3.681,2189.4395
and i'm proud to be one of them,2191.28,6.48,2194.52
i think you may be able to understand,2194.64,4.8,2197.04
but anyway do with this as you think,2199.44,3.44,2201.16
i trust you,2202.88,12.959,2209.3595
hey janet oh hello martin,2254.88,6.719,2258.2395

extra place at the dinner table,2315.44,4.8,2317.84

fascinating personality,2530.4,4.24,2532.52
they're swept right off their feet like,2532.16,3.679,2533.9995
yes but other people can be more,2535.839,4.24,2537.959
like me it's true chris,2540.079,6.24,2543.199
in many ways i'm more mature than you,2543.68,3.36,2545.3599999999997
janet i have lived through most of your,2547.04,4.16,2549.12
growing pains and oftentimes you've been,2548.96,4.32,2551.12
insufferable but tonight you see,2551.2,4.08,2553.24
you can't be objective you're getting,2553.28,3.44,2555.0
sore just because i'm trying to give you,2555.28,3.039,2556.7995
some good advice,2556.72,4.96,2559.2
give me advice janet it is good advice,2558.319,7.28,2561.959
alexis agrees with me alexis agrees with,2561.68,6.08,2564.72
you see i've talked to him a few times,2568.64,8.4,2572.8399999999997
about your problem i,2572.48,10.24,2577.6
i went to his house how did you find him,2577.04,9.2,2581.64
fascinating absolutely,2582.72,7.76,2586.6
fascinating you know,2586.24,7.0,2589.74
he has one of the most vibrant,2590.48,4.639,2592.7995
personalities,2593.24,3.64,2595.06
and you came to this conclusion while,2595.119,4.641,2597.4395
discussing my problem,2596.88,5.92,2599.84
well we talked a little about me too,2599.76,7.76,2603.6400000000003
janet good night,2602.8,8.16,2606.88
i'll leave you alone with your,2607.52,3.44,2609.24
objectivity,2618.839,49.1,2643.389
i feel a disturbance if we are to reach,2668.24,4.48,2670.4799999999996
the outer world tonight,2670.88,3.76,2672.76
we must leave behind us all thoughts,2672.72,3.599,2674.5195
that are hostile,2674.64,5.6,2677.44
and on a low emotional level,2676.319,3.921,2678.2795
now janet this is your first seance,2682.0,3.92,2683.96
there must be some skepticism in your,2684.319,2.0,2685.319
oh no perhaps only in your subconscious,2686.319,3.841,2688.2395
mind but nevertheless we shall proceed,2688.56,3.12,2690.12
under test conditions,2690.16,2.8,2691.56
if you would be good enough to hold this,2691.68,3.6,2693.48
key for me,2692.96,4.399,2695.1595
and christine will you tie my wrists,2695.28,3.839,2697.1995
together securely oh there's no need to,2697.359,3.681,2699.1994999999997
do that alexis i have every faith in you,2699.119,3.2,2700.719
oh but i insist,2701.04,3.279,2702.6795
for my own sake here chris you take the,2702.319,3.52,2704.079
key out his wrist,2704.319,5.52,2707.079
all right janet start with the right one,2705.839,4.0,2707.839
tie one knot in the center,2710.24,6.079,2713.2794999999996
tightly that's good now,2713.28,6.559,2716.5595000000003
tie my hands behind my back,2716.319,3.52,2718.079
very tightly,2720.8,2.799,2722.1995
now lock the cabinet so that you know,2729.92,4.88,2732.36
that i cannot possibly move from this,2733.2,3.919,2735.1594999999998
now christine will you switch off the,2742.56,6.32,2745.72
light the switch is right in behind you,2744.079,4.801,2746.4795000000004
the room must be completely dark,2750.96,9.92,2755.92
sit down on a table,2754.64,8.959,2759.1195
and clasp your hands together tightly,2760.88,6.56,2764.1600000000003
with a key between your palms,2763.599,3.841,2765.5195000000003
if you see anything at all do not move,2770.96,4.08,2773.0
or cry out,2775.04,14.799,2782.4395
chris look,2814.8,3.039,2816.3195
i remember him very well isn't that,2818.8,4.4,2821.0
do you feel it janet the chill,2842.16,4.64,2844.48
cold breeze like ice,2849.68,10.159,2854.7594999999997
i'd sure like to know what's going on in,2894.079,4.561,2896.3595
there if he's staging a sea answer it'd,2895.839,4.561,2898.1195
be a good opportunity to prove he's a,2898.64,3.199,2900.2394999999997
phony let's sneak around back there may,2900.4,3.04,2901.92
be a window we can look through,2901.839,14.0,2908.839
i'll climb through,2903.44,12.399,2909.6395
martin what are you doing showing you,2952.64,5.199,2955.2394999999997
what a pony this man is where's the key,2954.24,3.599,2956.0395
if you think he's still in here,2959.52,12.319,2965.6795
what is it he's quick on his feet i'll,2974.4,5.36,2977.08
say that for him how could he get out,2978.319,2.8,2979.719
when i locked him in,2979.76,3.44,2981.48
he could show you if he wanted to you,2981.119,4.24,2983.239
tie a knot like this,2983.2,6.0,2986.2
and then martin this is dreadful,2985.359,6.72,2988.719
yes it is i'm afraid i must insist you,2989.2,4.159,2991.2794999999996
don't come here again,2992.079,3.921,2994.0395000000003
insist by what right do you insist oh,2993.359,5.041,2995.8795
we're engaged well even if we were,2996.0,4.559,2998.2795
married i'd think as i pleased,2998.4,3.919,3000.3595
and i won't close my mind to truth just,3000.559,3.121,3002.1195000000002
because you don't happen to understand,3002.319,1.681,3003.1594999999998
truth poppycock be logical chris be,3004.0,4.0,3006.0
pardon me mr abbott do you think you,3008.0,3.599,3009.7995
could possibly defer your,3009.68,4.08,3011.72
discussion long enough to untie this,3011.599,3.041,3013.1195000000002
sorry alexis i'll do it i happen to,3014.64,3.76,3016.52
understand more about these things than,3016.96,2.96,3018.44
you do do you realize that man has a,3018.4,2.48,3019.64
criminal record,3019.92,2.8,3021.32
alexis told us he was once in prison if,3020.88,3.76,3022.76
that's what you mean sometimes a prison,3022.72,3.28,3024.3599999999997
record is something to be proud,3024.64,3.28,3026.2799999999997
of i'm terribly sorry about this,3026.0,3.359,3027.6795
interruption alexis,3027.92,4.639,3030.2395
i saw him i saw paul we will bring him,3029.359,3.601,3031.1594999999998
even if you could bring him back she'd,3032.96,3.76,3034.84
be better off if he stayed where he is,3035.04,2.24,3036.16
she never meant anything to him but,3037.28,3.44,3039.0
money martin he'd been married and,3038.64,3.84,3040.56
divorced before each time with cash,3040.72,2.48,3041.9599999999996
settlements,3042.48,2.4,3043.68
if he'd lived he'd have made you,3043.2,3.04,3044.72
miserable and,3044.88,3.92,3046.84
ended up where he belongs in jail i,3046.24,4.079,3048.2794999999996
never thought you'd attack a dead man,3048.8,2.72,3050.1600000000003
with lies he can't answer,3050.319,3.441,3052.0395
yes it's in the records when martin,3051.52,3.92,3053.48
disappeared did you or did you not ask,3053.76,3.52,3055.5200000000004
me to investigate,3055.44,4.96,3057.92
yes well in the course of my snooping i,3057.28,5.12,3059.84
found a second mrs faber,3060.4,3.84,3062.32
divorced in las vegas just six months,3062.4,3.439,3064.1195000000002
before he married you,3064.24,4.24,3066.3599999999997
i think he went over there to see her i,3065.839,4.401,3068.0395
never could find her though and,3068.48,4.8,3070.88
paul was dead so seems very strange if,3070.24,4.16,3072.3199999999997
it were true you didn't find it,3073.28,3.36,3074.96
necessary to tell mrs favor,3074.4,5.36,3077.08
yes i suppose it is strange,3076.64,4.88,3079.08
very silly to try and protect the girl,3079.76,4.079,3081.7995
she only runs as fast as she can to,3083.839,4.801,3086.2395
another phony like you,3085.599,5.121,3088.1595
come on hoffman let's get out of here,3088.64,3.36,3090.3199999999997
i'm going so soon,3090.72,3.28,3092.3599999999997
i hope we might stay around a while you,3092.0,3.839,3093.9195
should stay we've soon learned what,3094.0,3.68,3095.84
amazing powers alexis has,3095.839,4.401,3098.0395
i'm always willing to learn perhaps,3097.68,4.639,3099.9995
you'd like to resume the science,3100.24,6.64,3103.56
yes under real test conditions,3102.319,6.52,3105.579
and have you report me for conducting a,3106.88,3.6,3108.6800000000003
i should say no he probably could report,3110.48,4.079,3112.5195
but if you'll sit down here at this,3114.559,4.081,3116.5995000000003
table and while we all hold hands like,3116.48,3.599,3118.2795
real good friends,3118.64,3.439,3120.3595
if you can make any of your spirits walk,3120.079,4.321,3122.2395
or talk i think mr hoffman will let it,3122.079,3.76,3123.9590000000003
ride this time,3124.4,4.4,3126.6
it's ridiculous show them alexis yes,3125.839,4.961,3128.3195
do i'm afraid under such hostile,3130.8,4.0,3132.8
circumstances any contact with the,3133.2,2.879,3134.6394999999998
spirit world will be practically,3134.8,2.16,3135.88
impossible,3136.079,2.721,3137.4395
yeah yeah i've heard that patter routine,3136.96,4.0,3138.96
before i know it's easier when you can,3138.8,3.68,3140.6400000000003
run around the room in the dark,3140.96,4.56,3143.2400000000002
it doesn't run around in the dark go on,3142.48,3.839,3144.3995
let them see for themselves what you can,3146.319,3.361,3147.9995
okay let's go,3149.68,4.159,3151.7594999999997
you know you really ought to hand down,3169.68,4.08,3171.72
the premises for tight spots like this,3171.04,4.4,3173.24
we checked you see to make sure you,3173.76,4.0,3175.76
hadn't talked so loud,3175.44,6.399,3178.6395
you mean we'll frighten the ghosts,3177.76,4.079,3179.7995
it's paul it's his voice,3224.8,7.36,3228.48
i didn't mean to frighten you ever but i,3229.04,5.76,3231.92
had to get through to you somehow,3232.16,5.84,3235.08
i've always loved you you know that yes,3234.8,5.44,3237.52
and if you could only believe we could,3245.92,5.919,3248.8795
be together for always,3248.48,3.359,3250.1595
wasn't anybody out there 20 years never,3267.119,6.081,3270.1595
anything like this,3270.319,2.881,3271.7595
if everybody will excuse me this has,3273.28,6.559,3276.5595000000003
been a terrible strain,3275.92,3.919,3277.8795
come on chris i'll take you home,3280.88,15.92,3288.84
what are you so startled about you're,3324.48,4.639,3326.7995
used to raising the debt aren't you,3326.559,4.161,3328.6395
although i guess with me it was a little,3329.119,6.72,3332.4790000000003
easier because i'm only legally dead,3330.72,6.879,3334.1594999999998
you know i've been watching you ever,3335.839,4.161,3337.9195
since my widow started coming to you,3337.599,3.52,3339.3590000000004
i find your methods quite amusing,3341.119,3.841,3343.0395000000003
hmm excellent,3346.96,3.92,3348.92
how do you get out of that rope thing,3355.76,3.359,3357.4395000000004
manipulation,3359.28,2.799,3360.6795
just push a button and the idiots reach,3367.92,3.28,3369.56
for their checkbooks,3370.16,3.52,3371.92
it isn't quite as simple as all that,3371.2,4.08,3373.24
there's a lot of psychology involved in,3373.68,3.04,3375.2
sounds dangerously like work,3376.72,5.28,3379.3599999999997
however your bag of tricks can be useful,3380.16,4.48,3382.3999999999996
to us in our present plans,3382.0,6.559,3385.2795
we um have plans,3384.64,5.36,3387.3199999999997
i didn't help you out tonight just for,3388.559,3.04,3390.079
the fun of it my friend,3390.0,5.52,3392.76
i can use you you see i need money,3391.599,8.081,3395.6395
a lot of it i don't understand,3395.52,5.52,3398.28
if you went back to christine you could,3399.68,3.28,3401.3199999999997
have anything you want,3401.04,3.6,3402.84
you don't seem to have a very analytical,3402.96,4.08,3405.0
mind but christine still loves you,3404.64,6.479,3407.8795
she hmm you mean if you weren't dead the,3407.04,5.44,3409.7599999999998
police might want to know who it was,3411.119,4.881,3413.5595000000003
they found burnt to death in your car,3412.48,3.52,3414.2400000000002
if i've been using the wrong piece of,3419.04,3.12,3420.6
music what,3420.48,3.839,3422.3995
oh no no you have the right one for,3422.16,3.919,3424.1195
i used this one for my first wife,3426.079,3.681,3427.9195
was it her ashes they found in the car,3430.079,5.921,3433.0395000000003
it was me they found in the car don't,3433.52,4.96,3436.0
perhaps i should point out that i'm in a,3438.48,4.0,3440.48
very curious position,3440.4,4.0,3442.4
since i believed dead i could even kill,3442.48,5.599,3445.2795
a man nobody think of looking for me,3444.4,6.399,3447.5995000000003
you're in a curious position too alexis,3448.079,4.561,3450.3595
you can't tell anybody i'm alive,3450.799,4.481,3453.0395
without exposing yourself that's right i,3452.64,3.52,3454.4
it is a very curious position and a,3456.16,4.56,3458.44
profitable one,3458.4,3.679,3460.2395
i don't think it's too premature to,3460.72,3.2,3462.3199999999997
congratulate you upon an extremely,3462.079,4.961,3464.5595000000003
advantageous marriage,3463.92,3.12,3465.48
come come my friend you must be prepared,3467.76,3.92,3469.7200000000003
to make some small sacrifices,3469.92,4.0,3471.92
you don't expect me to marry christine,3471.68,5.6,3474.48
no no the little one janet,3473.92,5.12,3476.48
she's still young enough to be dazzled,3477.28,3.68,3479.1200000000003
from then on getting that estate will be,3480.96,4.56,3483.2400000000002
like taking candy away from a baby,3482.64,6.0,3485.64
i don't think christine would allow it,3485.52,6.4,3488.72
i'll take care of christine,3488.64,3.28,3490.2799999999997
i'm a little rusty on this one i'll have,3496.319,4.48,3498.5589999999997
to practice,3498.24,2.559,3499.5195
have this piano tuned will you,3500.88,16.959,3509.3595
oh no ma'am not for you not after the,3526.72,3.28,3528.3599999999997
you've been heavy yeah that's for you,3530.0,6.319,3533.1595
hot milk yes ma'am i'd rather have the,3533.599,5.121,3536.1595
i'll see that she drinks it emily,3541.359,5.601,3544.1594999999998
all right i'll take it but it won't do,3545.599,3.441,3547.3195
any good you should really try and get,3546.96,4.0,3548.96
more sleep christine,3549.04,5.759,3551.9195
but i just can't i'm never alone anymore,3550.96,5.04,3553.48
keep hearing his voice now and seeing,3556.0,5.119,3558.5595
it should comfort me i suppose but it's,3561.2,4.399,3563.3995
been frightening,3562.96,4.399,3565.1595
drink your milk while it's hot it'll,3565.599,3.921,3567.5595000000003
alexis do you suppose we've made a,3569.52,4.48,3571.7599999999998
that first day when i came to your house,3574.0,3.28,3575.64
you said it might be better to,3575.599,3.601,3577.3995
repel paul's spirit instead of bringing,3577.28,4.0,3579.28
perhaps you were right perhaps i was,3581.28,3.519,3583.0395000000003
then would it be better to try to break,3584.799,3.201,3586.3995
the contact now and not go,3586.48,4.079,3588.5195
too late at this stage i could never,3588.0,4.96,3590.48
break the contact,3590.559,4.881,3592.9995000000004
we'll have to finish what we started it,3592.96,7.359,3596.6395
would only bring me rest,3595.44,9.44,3600.16
well let's let's begin the seance now,3600.319,4.561,3602.5995
i think that before we start you should,3605.76,4.24,3607.88
and i should be more familiar with the,3610.0,3.359,3611.6795
surroundings,3611.44,3.679,3613.2795
it is very difficult for me in a strange,3613.359,4.081,3615.3995
perhaps if i walked around the outside,3617.44,5.52,3620.2000000000003
for a while we can even go to the ocean,3619.119,10.72,3624.4790000000003
go ahead janet i'm feeling rather tired,3622.96,6.879,3626.3995
watch your step it's awfully steep,3656.88,14.959,3664.3595
you know i think i have talent along,3689.44,3.919,3691.3995
spirit lines,3691.52,4.079,3693.5595
you do yes i've been reading and,3693.359,3.2,3694.959
i think maybe i'm mediumistic you know,3696.559,4.721,3698.9195
that seance we had at your house when,3699.68,2.56,3700.96
paul appeared,3701.28,4.799,3703.6795
yeah was that paul's first visitation,3702.24,7.68,3706.08
alexis well oh yes it was,3706.079,6.24,3709.199
you see maybe it's because i was there,3709.92,5.36,3712.6
all tuned in and sensitive,3712.319,5.201,3714.9195
well it could be did you ever see a,3715.28,5.44,3718.0
better spirit manifestation,3717.52,10.319,3722.6795
no then that was an all-time record,3720.72,7.119,3724.2794999999996
are you thinking about my sister yeah,3737.2,7.68,3741.04
she's very attractive isn't she,3741.44,6.96,3744.92
most men admire chris but christine will,3744.88,6.64,3748.2000000000003
always belong to paul i suppose that's,3748.4,5.36,3751.08
i wish you wouldn't be so unhappy,3753.76,3.68,3755.6000000000004
do you suppose they'll be joined,3758.319,3.04,3759.839
together someday,3759.839,4.0,3761.839
and celestial companionship through all,3761.359,3.76,3763.239
like it says in the books yes i'm sure,3765.119,4.051,3767.1445000000003
alexis do you think i'd make a good,3770.4,6.24,3773.52
celestial companion,3774.319,4.48,3776.5589999999997
darling i think you'd be wonderful and,3776.64,3.52,3778.4
we'd love each other through all,3778.799,2.161,3779.8795
oh even longer alexis,3780.96,6.24,3784.08
why don't we start right here on the,3785.599,12.24,3791.719
earth plane,3787.2,10.639,3792.5195
i come for you dear,3868.559,6.59,3871.8540000000003
all right chris,3877.839,6.321,3880.9995
i'm frightened there's nothing to be,3884.88,10.959,3890.3595
race you to the beach,3934.559,3.28,3936.199
last one is a coward,3939.52,20.479,3949.7595
alexis she's not badly hurt she's all,4022.48,3.68,4024.32
i think she's all right,4026.16,9.679,4030.9995
what are you doing here well at the,4044.559,3.921,4046.5195000000003
moment i'm opening the door,4046.72,4.24,4048.8399999999997
but not very wide you're not exactly,4048.48,4.079,4050.5195
welcome here,4050.96,4.48,4053.2
where's emily it's thursday mr abbott,4052.559,4.961,4055.0395000000003
her day off,4055.44,4.8,4057.84
where's frida freda left yesterday she,4057.52,3.12,4059.08
she thought the house was haunted and i,4060.64,4.64,4062.96
can see what she means,4063.2,4.24,4065.3199999999997
i want to talk to mrs faber i don't,4065.28,5.36,4067.96
think she wants to talk to you,4067.44,3.2,4069.04
janet where's chris she's in bed,4071.359,5.361,4074.0395
she's making herself ill with this,4075.119,4.081,4077.1595
morbid nonsense oh it isn't that,4076.72,4.72,4079.08
chris had a fall last night on the cliff,4079.2,3.68,4081.04
she might have killed herself if alexis,4081.44,2.56,4082.7200000000003
hadn't caught it,4082.88,5.52,4085.6400000000003
what was she doing on the cliff well,4084.0,9.52,4088.76
she thought she heard paul calling janet,4088.4,8.48,4092.64
we'll always be together chris,4093.52,3.36,4095.2
together always yes,4098.08,4.48,4100.32
you'll always be mine chris,4102.719,3.921,4104.6795
chris i'm waiting,4112.799,7.04,4116.319
what'd the doctor say chris wouldn't,4141.199,4.48,4143.438999999999
have a doctor,4143.679,4.0,4145.679
you've got to be logical about this,4145.679,3.6,4147.479
she's not badly hurt,4147.679,3.361,4149.3595000000005
she's just bruised and shaken in the,4149.279,4.161,4151.3595000000005
first place she's in a state of hysteria,4151.04,3.759,4152.9195
in the second place she shouldn't be in,4153.44,2.96,4154.919999999999
this house everything in it reminds her,4154.799,2.56,4156.079
and finally she shouldn't be left alone,4157.359,3.36,4159.039000000001
for one second there's no telling what,4158.96,2.48,4160.2
she might do,4160.719,2.801,4162.1195
but i'm with her all the time i haven't,4161.44,4.239,4163.559499999999
chris martin,4191.759,5.92,4194.719
chris are you all right yes of course,4194.8,5.84,4197.72
what's in that bottle,4197.679,2.961,4199.1595
it's just aspirin i've got a headache,4200.719,5.281,4203.3595000000005
chris it's dangerous for you to stay,4206.4,3.68,4208.24
you need rest and care perhaps in a,4210.08,3.2,4211.68
you're trying to separate us i won't go,4213.28,3.76,4215.16
to a hospital,4215.84,2.72,4217.2
i won't leave this house only until,4217.04,3.679,4218.8795

if you hadn't tried to play the hero,4245.36,2.319,4246.519499999999
last night all this wouldn't be,4246.64,2.079,4247.6795
i had to save janet didn't i you're not,4248.719,4.48,4250.959
falling in love with her are you,4250.96,4.08,4253.0
look if i'm going to marry into this,4253.199,3.441,4254.9195
estate there's got to be somebody for me,4255.04,3.04,4256.56
just by way of making conversation that,4258.08,4.32,4260.24
wife of mine in las vegas the one who,4260.64,3.28,4262.280000000001
tried to back out on me and wanted her,4262.4,3.44,4264.12
cash settlement back,4263.92,5.68,4266.76
i settled with her but not for cash,4265.84,5.52,4268.6
now if you should back out on me i,4269.6,3.28,4271.240000000001
wouldn't hesitate to settle with you,4271.36,3.28,4273.0
either alexis,4272.88,5.359,4275.5595
because you're in such a curious,4274.64,3.599,4276.4395
how long chris how long must i wait,4298.8,17.04,4307.320000000001
china get out of here why didn't you,4376.56,5.04,4379.080000000001
tell me you wanted money that badly,4379.36,5.76,4382.24
i'd given it to you just to get rid of,4381.6,8.639,4385.9195
oh yes i'm alive,4385.12,6.559,4388.3994999999995
legally i'm dead and i'm going to stay,4390.239,4.081,4392.2795
that way but if you're alive i won't be,4391.679,4.241,4393.7995
it's too bad you came down here,4395.92,3.52,4397.68
okay chris wake up,4448.48,3.92,4450.44
can't explain quick we'll take the,4453.199,11.771,4459.0845
backstairs,4466.84,3.0,4468.34
you forgot paul my profession is,4482.64,15.2,4490.240000000001
raising the dead,4486.8,11.04,4492.320000000001
you're losing quite a bit of blood,4518.32,7.52,4522.08
aren't you alexis,4519.84,6.0,4522.84
spirits don't need any blood,4525.92,3.52,4527.68
do you think bullets can harm us ghosts,4534.08,5.76,4536.96
too bad you missed those were,4556.719,9.621,4561.5295
your last two shots,4561.199,8.47,4565.433999999999
the police are here my friend your gun,4570.32,4.879,4572.7595

witness my best performance,4578.4,4.4,4580.599999999999
you made one little mistake i started,4580.48,4.4,4582.679999999999
with seven shells,4582.8,11.39,4588.495
i have one in the chamber,4584.88,12.72,4591.24
alexis you were wonderful,4597.6,6.72,4600.96
i guess there must be a better side to,4602.64,3.84,4604.56
but now you must forgive me no never,4606.48,4.88,4608.919999999999

future is bright janet,4611.36,5.359,4614.0395
don't you go clinging to the past,4613.44,6.0,4616.44
i lived by feeding people's desire to,4616.719,6.721,4620.0795
escape the present,4619.44,7.84,4623.36
but you can't escape for long,4623.44,7.04,4626.96
alexis i'm afraid for you,4627.28,6.8,4630.679999999999
i'll be all right i'll find some spirits,4630.48,6.56,4633.759999999999

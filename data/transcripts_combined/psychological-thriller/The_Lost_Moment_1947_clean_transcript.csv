carrying a walking stick,1310.32,3.959,1312.2994999999999
Mr Burton must have some business in the,1321.52,4.92,1323.98
I hope I haven't taken up too much of,1393.919,3.64,1395.739
your time father no but I did want to,1395.159,4.561,1397.4395000000002
get to know you I am,1397.559,4.841,1399.9795
pleased you must be very lonely where,1399.72,5.48,1402.46
you are Mr Burton at times I,1402.4,7.24,1406.02
am there um the rather strange people,1405.2,7.079,1408.7395000000001
father in what,1409.64,4.96,1412.1200000000001
way this may interest,1412.279,5.241,1414.8995
you just look at those,1414.6,6.76,1417.98
signatures Miss Juliana signed it no,1417.52,6.279,1420.6595
Miss Tina signed both of,1421.36,4.08,1423.3999999999999
oh are you concerned about its legality,1425.44,7.56,1429.22
Mr Burton no I just um I thought it was,1429.039,5.281,1431.6795
did Mr Burton let us be frank with each,1437.44,6.719,1440.7995
other when Miss Tina told me that you,1441.6,4.6,1443.8999999999999
were coming into their house as a lodger,1444.159,5.281,1446.7995
I wondering about it what would a young,1446.2,6.16,1449.28
man or means obviously want in a place,1449.44,6.8,1452.8400000000001
like that escape from the World perhaps,1452.36,6.96,1455.84
forget an unhappy little Affair which is,1456.24,4.48,1458.48
Burton neither father I uh write as I,1460.72,7.28,1464.3600000000001
explained to misstina of course I do,1465.679,5.0,1468.179
confess a certain amount of uh curiosity,1468.0,4.559,1470.2795
I put it out of my mind Mr,1470.679,4.24,1472.799
Burton a normal young man wouldn't want,1472.559,4.681,1474.8995
to live in that house in a me of,1474.919,5.601,1477.7195000000002
time unless he had a special,1477.24,7.439,1480.9595
reason what do you suspect me of,1480.52,4.159,1482.5995
Father Miss Tina and Miss Juliana are,1485.039,6.36,1488.219
not average people they have a life of,1487.76,7.279,1491.3995
their own a world of their own and a,1491.399,6.441,1494.6194999999998
stranger upsetting the balance of that,1495.039,4.681,1497.3795
world even un waiting,1497.84,4.52,1500.1
me you wouldn't want to cause a tragedy,1499.72,4.079,1501.7595000000001
would you Mr,1502.36,4.88,1504.8
Burton you seem to feel that I have some,1503.799,7.801,1507.6995
deep dark motive what father I don't,1507.24,7.28,1510.88
know but I do know that a blunder might,1511.6,5.84,1514.52
unleash things far beyond your,1514.52,5.639,1517.3395
control and my,1517.44,8.28,1521.5800000000002
control I would be very careful Mr B,1520.159,5.561,1522.9395000000002
if I had any hopes of finding the,1530.679,4.36,1532.8590000000002
letters quickly they were soon dispel I,1532.159,5.801,1535.0595
was in a blind alley I never even so,1535.039,4.721,1537.3995
much as caught a glimpse of Miss Juliana,1537.96,4.199,1540.0595
Tina I wondered what they did and what,1542.799,5.041,1545.3195
they talked about they seem to me like,1545.159,6.201,1548.2595000000001
hunted creatures figing,1547.84,3.52,1549.6
is that you Mr,1659.12,7.799,1663.0194999999999
Burton please do come in,1662.0,4.919,1664.4595
it would seem I'm not the only one who,1680.44,3.68,1682.28
sleep I no need to,1684.12,5.84,1687.04
explain no,1687.12,6.399,1690.3194999999998
need I was afraid for a moment I hadn't,1689.96,5.4,1692.66
anything that would be awful wouldn't it,1695.36,6.88,1698.8
just to imagine,1699.36,4.799,1701.7595
things yes it,1702.24,6.319,1705.3995

fortunate they want to take my house,1723.44,6.68,1726.78

where'd it come from,1949.12,8.07,1953.155

past and here was,2142.48,6.4,2145.68
Juliana real beyond belief beautiful,2144.839,6.601,2148.1394999999998

her father told me he saw you I can,2270.72,7.119,2274.2794999999996
imagine how unpleasant it must have been,2274.52,6.599,2277.8195
in a way I pity him,2277.839,3.28,2279.479
Jeffrey he's leaving for Rome next week,2281.24,5.28,2283.8799999999997

P I saw the senorina this morning and I,2469.48,5.08,2472.02
said to her like you told me if she,2473.28,3.24,2474.9

seora just the same cut a basket full of,2483.44,6.12,2486.5
roses and have them sent up Miss,2486.16,3.4,2487.8599999999997
Julie this came for you a little while,2491.48,6.56,2494.76

day I hadn't noticed it,2500.4,5.52,2503.1600000000003
especially if you'll excuse me I asked,2502.88,4.959,2505.3595
Petra to cut some roses for your aunt,2505.92,3.36,2507.6
that was very considerate of you Mr,2507.839,3.601,2509.6394999999998
Burton but don't you think she'd like,2509.28,4.44,2511.5
them I had the feeling that she'd love,2511.44,4.36,2513.62
things and that one once she herself was,2515.8,8.039,2519.8195
beautiful she was is there a portrait of,2520.4,4.76,2522.78
her in the,2523.839,4.681,2526.1794999999997
house no what a,2525.16,5.4,2527.8599999999997
Pity I would have given anything to have,2528.52,3.76,2530.4
seen what she was,2530.56,4.6,2532.86
like her hair down about her,2532.28,6.44,2535.5
shoulders her eyes shining her beauty,2535.16,6.159,2538.2394999999997
the despair of,2538.72,7.119,2542.2794999999996
ports was she happy,2541.319,4.52,2543.579
I've often wondered if beauty doesn't,2547.8,4.44,2550.02
bring more sorrow than,2549.119,3.121,2550.6795
happiness Miss,2552.96,5.879,2555.8995
Tina last night I heard music music,2554.96,5.599,2557.7595
we're a long way from the Pia it wasn't,2558.839,4.841,2561.2595
that kind of music I heard it in my,2560.559,6.481,2563.7995
room it was faint,2563.68,5.6,2566.48
lovely it seemed like music out of,2567.04,4.0,2569.04
Century that came from the other side of,2571.04,4.68,2573.38
the house you must be a writer of,2573.28,5.16,2575.86
romantic stories Mr B,2575.72,4.32,2577.8799999999997
no one lives on the other side of the,2578.44,4.56,2580.7200000000003
house and there couldn't have been any,2580.04,5.76,2582.92
perhaps after all this place does,2585.8,4.88,2588.2400000000002
stimulate one's,2587.92,2.76,2589.3
imagination Mr,2591.96,4.639,2594.2795
Burton I've never understood why you,2594.2,4.52,2596.46
came here but for whatever reason it,2596.599,4.931,2599.0645
would be better if you left,2598.72,5.909,2601.6744999999996
this time I was instructed to see you,2608.04,6.88,2611.48
father by whom Miss bordo the Elder oh I,2609.64,7.919,2613.5995
uh purchased a painting from her a,2614.92,4.96,2617.4
miniature the sum was,2617.559,4.361,2619.7395
"£1,000 she didn't want her niece to know",2619.88,3.4,2621.58
about the transaction she instructed me,2621.92,4.28,2624.06
to bring the money to you here it is she,2623.28,4.76,2625.6600000000003
said you would know what to do with it,2626.2,5.399,2628.8995
when did you see her last night father,2628.04,7.519,2631.7995
and misstina knows nothing about it,2631.599,6.361,2634.7795
no well thank you thank you Mr Burton,2635.559,5.0,2638.059
for bringing the money if I may father,2637.96,5.24,2640.58
I'd like to ask a question why,2640.559,5.721,2643.4195
certainly well I um read a rather,2643.2,4.44,2645.4199999999996
curious story,2646.28,3.52,2648.0400000000004
yesterday in a strange way it was,2647.64,4.04,2649.66
concerned with faith the power of,2649.8,4.48,2652.04
believing what was the story Mr Burton,2651.68,3.879,2653.6195
it was about a,2654.28,4.039,2656.2995
girl who seemed to lead two,2655.559,5.881,2658.4995000000004
lives one in the present and the other,2658.319,4.201,2660.4195
past you have found out about Miss Tina,2662.52,6.96,2666.0
I was afraid that you,2667.4,4.76,2669.78
would my advice to you Mr Burton is to,2669.48,4.72,2671.84
leave before I caused the tragedy you,2672.16,5.679,2674.9995
spoke about yes isn't it a tragedy now,2674.2,6.639,2677.5195
father perhaps Mr Burton but if she,2677.839,5.161,2680.4195
didn't have the past she would have,2680.839,5.24,2683.459
nothing there she knows happiness even a,2683.0,6.8,2686.4
Kind of Love there is nothing no one in,2686.079,6.441,2689.2995
the present who can give it that that's,2689.8,6.16,2692.88
why in her case I prefer illusion to,2692.52,5.48,2695.2599999999998
your money will save The Bard the RO,2698.0,5.359,2700.6795

blocking my path to the,3978.279,3.84,3980.199
letters and to the end of this,3980.0,5.839,3982.9195
terrifying venture,3982.119,3.72,3983.9790000000003

sleep after what's happened to you,4017.72,5.0,4020.22
tonight I wanted to have a talk with you,4019.96,4.319,4022.1195000000002

Juliana one never knows about her Dr,4024.279,6.601,4027.5795
casana just left from a medical point of,4027.799,5.681,4030.6394999999998
view she's dying but then she's been,4030.88,4.239,4032.9995

mind at rest if that's necessary Mr,4040.599,5.601,4043.3995
Burton Miss Tina seemed to think that,4043.279,4.52,4045.539
you were the,4046.2,4.079,4048.2394999999997
Intruder a little while ago Miss Jana,4047.799,5.401,4050.4995
was able to speak for a few moments she,4050.279,6.56,4053.559
said it wasn't,4053.2,3.639,4055.0195
you how are you an apology Mr Burton an,4057.48,8.76,4061.86
apology for what oh the way I reacted to,4061.599,7.321,4065.2595
your Humane curiosity about Miss Tina I,4066.24,4.319,4068.3995
thought about it after you,4068.92,5.439,4071.6395
left like my good friend Dr casano I,4070.559,6.24,4073.679
sometimes have a tenden to form snap,4074.359,4.601,4076.6594999999998
judgments we look at the color of a,4076.799,5.721,4079.6594999999998
man's eyes notice his posture sniff the,4078.96,7.28,4082.6
air and we not only guess his illness,4082.52,6.12,4085.58
but decide whether he's a decent fellow,4086.24,3.96,4088.22
scoundrel and your diagnosis was that um,4090.2,6.959,4093.6794999999997
scoundrel a mistaken,4097.159,6.441,4100.3795
diagnosis I was mistaken about Miss Tina,4100.759,4.801,4103.1595
because to love a shadow is not love I,4105.56,6.48,4108.8
was in this house when she was brought,4109.96,3.52,4111.72
world she never had a chance there was,4113.48,5.48,4116.219999999999
Escape I thought about you for a long,4119.759,4.281,4121.8995
Burke it seemed to me that you were in,4124.04,5.639,4126.8595
love with Miss Tina and that you might,4126.679,5.48,4129.419
win out over your,4129.679,6.961,4133.1595
rival Jeffrey Ashton,4132.159,4.481,4134.3994999999995
if Miss Tina were to love someone in the,4140.199,6.801,4143.599499999999
present love him deeply Mr Burton that,4143.64,7.24,4147.26
love might cure,4147.0,3.88,4148.94
her good night,4153.12,6.679,4156.4595
Mr good night father,4155.319,4.48,4157.559
Tina can I do anything no thank you I'm,4176.679,6.761,4180.0595
sorry you'd rather be,4181.04,4.52,4183.3
no do you think she'll,4185.56,5.96,4188.54
die no Miss Tina I don't think she will,4188.04,6.88,4191.48
there'd be nothing I'd be lost without,4191.52,4.4,4193.72
she's better it's fantastic but she's,4195.92,6.56,4199.2
better no Tina she must be left alone,4198.8,5.16,4201.38
she would know when you came into the,4202.48,3.88,4204.419999999999
room and it would excite,4203.96,6.279,4207.0995
her there's nothing to worry,4206.36,6.6,4209.66
about I'd like you to get out of this,4210.239,5.521,4212.9995

her in the,4215.76,5.2,4218.360000000001
morning if I may be so bold I would like,4217.92,5.52,4220.68

Canal and heard the music there yes,4418.76,5.16,4421.34
sometimes you can hear it from our house,4421.92,4.08,4423.96
when the night is very,4423.92,4.52,4426.18
still when I was little I used to wonder,4426.0,5.199,4428.5995
about it and when you grew,4428.44,7.52,4432.2
up I never thought about it,4431.199,6.0,4434.199
uh remember your family my,4437.199,8.081,4441.2395
parents I never knew,4442.679,5.441,4445.3995
them they lived with my aunt when I was,4445.28,5.2,4447.88
born much later I was told that they,4448.12,6.119,4451.1795
died in an accident there was no,4450.48,7.6,4454.28
feeling because there was no,4454.239,5.761,4457.1195
memory there would always be memories of,4458.08,2.72,4459.44
Juliana she's my family,4460.8,4.6,4463.1
would you care to dance Miss,4477.04,6.84,4480.46
Tina would you,4479.679,4.201,4481.7795
strange I closed my eyes and I thought I,4558.679,6.761,4562.0595
thought that you're the loveliest woman,4562.92,5.0,4565.42
known what are you doing there,4572.92,4.719,4575.2795
he got away I saw him he was trying to,4600.52,4.48,4602.76
reach for the singor in a purse he was a,4602.719,4.841,4605.1395
thief that's,4605.0,5.04,4607.52
strange he seems to have taken nothing,4607.56,4.36,4609.740000000001
oh no no Sorina I saw him before he,4610.04,3.679,4611.8795

too when I think how rudely I've behaved,4633.8,6.359,4636.9795
toward you these past weeks no I,4637.239,5.92,4640.199
understood but I don't,4640.159,6.161,4643.2395
understand and tonight,4643.159,7.161,4646.7395
tonight you've been very,4646.32,4.0,4648.32
kind after you've gone I hope you won't,4651.159,6.48,4654.398999999999
think too poorly of your stay here I,4654.56,5.72,4657.42
promise you I,4657.639,2.641,4658.9595
won't isn't there someone waiting for,4661.4,6.12,4664.46
you I saw her picture in your,4664.4,6.799,4667.7995
room do you love,4667.52,3.679,4669.3595000000005
her I would imagine imagine you loved,4673.32,4.72,4675.679999999999
much I'm not sure that we ever cared for,4678.199,6.721,4681.559499999999
each other the way it's possible to care,4681.96,6.96,4685.44
it was more as if we comforted each,4684.92,9.08,4689.46
other while waiting for someone else,4688.92,5.08,4691.46
I never thought I'd be standing here,4722.239,3.881,4724.179499999999
like this with,4724.0,5.76,4726.88
you not wanting to say good night I,4726.12,7.32,4729.78
thought it when,4729.76,7.36,4733.4400000000005
often at time times I'd watch you in the,4733.44,6.04,4736.46
garden and when you'd,4737.12,4.519,4739.3795
leave and when you'd come back from the,4739.48,4.88,4741.919999999999
city I wondered why you avoided me,4741.639,5.281,4744.279500000001
sometimes you know what I used to think,4744.36,5.44,4747.08
no but there was some awful secret you,4746.92,5.64,4749.74
were hiding secret and when your aunt,4749.8,6.16,4752.88
told me that she knew Jeffrey,4752.56,5.56,4755.34
Aston I thought it had something to do,4755.96,3.92,4757.92
that I was afraid that you wanted his,4759.88,5.52,4762.64
letters his letters,4763.08,5.159,4765.6595
many months ago a publisher wrote and,4765.4,5.16,4767.98
asked about,4768.239,4.721,4770.599499999999
them his name was lisis,4770.56,4.8,4772.96
Venable I wrote him that we knew nothing,4772.96,6.36,4776.14
about such letters but they do exist the,4775.36,6.4,4778.5599999999995
love she knew the love he gave her was,4779.32,4.48,4781.5599999999995
hers alone not to be shared with anyone,4781.76,4.6,4784.06
Tina to have known that kind of love to,4783.8,5.439,4786.5195
have filled one's life Tina listen to,4786.36,5.92,4789.32
me men like Jeffrey Ashton happen very,4789.239,6.601,4792.5395
rarely and what they leave behind Tina,4792.28,5.8,4795.179999999999
the glow the,4795.84,4.92,4798.3
shadow every scrap of memory every,4798.08,4.68,4800.42
remembered speech every,4800.76,4.479,4802.9995
letter belongs to the millions who live,4802.76,3.399,4804.4595
them do you want the,4806.159,3.681,4807.9995
letters if I did would you get them for,4812.0,7.639,4815.8195
me I don't know what I,4816.56,6.24,4819.68
do or wouldn't,4819.639,5.891,4822.5845
do I must go,4822.8,5.08,4825.34
night good night Tina,4828.92,4.4,4831.12
for a moment I,4872.6,5.44,4875.320000000001
hesitated the memory of the evening of,4874.4,9.88,4879.339999999999
Tina lovely beyond words held me but no,4878.04,7.28,4881.68
it was is an,4884.28,4.24,4886.4
illusion the letters the letters alone,4885.32,7.23,4888.9349999999995
were what I had come for were what I,4888.52,18.8,4897.92
wanted is that you Mr Burton,4907.32,56.369,4935.5045
where are the letters oh don't you spy,5047.08,6.52,5050.34

bribes and now you've stolen the letters,5053.6,5.48,5056.34
Rosa I'm Juliana not you give me the,5055.88,5.64,5058.7
letters Rosa they are my letters you,5059.08,5.88,5062.0199999999995
took them give them to me he has the now,5061.52,6.24,5064.64
Mr Burton I told him where they were to,5064.96,5.52,5067.72
bring them to me they're mine give them,5067.76,5.24,5070.38
to me Jeffrey is waiting for me now,5070.48,5.8,5073.379999999999
nobody's waiting for you Jeffrey is dead,5073.0,7.199,5076.5995
Tina dead for both of us father buried,5076.28,6.52,5079.54
him in the garden near the,5080.199,8.0,5084.199
bow I killed him I killed him he was,5082.8,9.2,5087.400000000001
going to leave me and I killed him give,5088.199,7.401,5091.8994999999995
them to me,5092.0,3.6,5093.8
Tina here are the ladders Tina,5111.92,32.569,5128.2045
at that moment I recalled Juliana's,5253.56,6.4,5256.76
words as long as she had that house she,5256.92,5.3,5259.57
would never die,5259.96,17.01,5268.465
and as long as Tina had been in that,5278.92,6.12,5281.9800000000005
house among its memories she had never,5281.6,6.44,5284.820000000001

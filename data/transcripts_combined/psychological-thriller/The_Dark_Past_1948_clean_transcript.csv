good evening and welcome to Full Moon,31.72,4.839,34.1395
matina I'm your host the detective,33.76,4.959,36.2395
bringing you the finest crime dramas and,36.559,4.48,38.799
film Noir from the Golden Age of,38.719,5.68,41.559
Hollywood tonight's picture is from,41.039,6.561,44.319500000000005
1948 The dark past starring William,44.399,7.64,48.219
Holden Nina fos Lee J Cobb and Adele,47.6,8.0,51.6
Jurgens it's directed by Rudolph M and,52.039,7.961,56.0195
its cinematographer is Joseph Walker now,55.6,7.44,59.32
this picture and it's made by Colombia,60.0,6.64,63.32
pictures this is a remake of,63.04,7.24,66.66
1939's blind alley which was also by,66.64,6.44,69.86
Colombia and it's based on a play that,70.28,5.26,72.91
was written by James,73.08,3.6,74.88
Warwick now this is it's something of a,76.68,6.72,80.04
psychological Thriller uh much like we,80.52,5.639,83.3395
see in a lot of British noirs from this,83.4,4.6,85.7
era you know it just seemed like the,86.159,4.96,88.63900000000001
British had a penchant uh they like to,88.0,5.759,90.87950000000001
do a lot of noirs that had like a,91.119,5.881,94.0595
psychological aspect to them and not,93.759,6.04,96.779
that Hollywood didn't do any like that,97.0,5.24,99.62
but they seem to be fewer in,99.799,5.521,102.5595
number and so on that aspect it kind of,102.24,6.72,105.6
reminds me of a British Noir but this is,105.32,6.52,108.58
an American,108.96,2.88,110.39999999999999
Film now it's about a deranged killer,112.28,6.64,115.6
who escapes prison and takes a,116.159,5.401,118.85950000000001
psychiatrist family and their weekend,118.92,7.08,122.46000000000001
guest hostage but the doctor is unshaken,121.56,7.52,125.32000000000001
and he helps the uh he helps the Killer,126.0,5.84,128.92
by trying to decipher a recurring,129.08,5.239,131.6995
nightmare that he thinks may be the,131.84,4.2,133.94
cause of his,134.319,4.401,136.5195
crimes so from,136.04,7.23,139.655
1948 the dark passed let's roll the,138.72,9.969,143.7045
what does a big city mean to you you may,224.599,5.481,227.3395
think of soaring skyscrapers monuments,227.519,4.241,229.6395
creation but I think of the people the,231.76,5.96,234.73999999999998
one and the many no names no faces I'm,234.76,5.64,237.57999999999998
one of the people too I've got my,237.72,5.28,240.35999999999999
routine same as all of them I rush for,240.4,4.52,242.66
work usually just in time to catch the,243.0,4.68,245.34
last bus always late part of that last,244.92,4.679,247.25949999999997
crowd yet for all the similarity of our,249.599,5.681,252.43949999999998
routine we're none of us the same we're,252.28,5.44,255.0
is different as the print of our,255.28,4.6,257.58
thumbs ever think about the differences,257.72,4.88,260.16
in people I do sort of a little game I,259.88,5.36,262.56
play a guessing,262.6,5.2,265.20000000000005
game guess what she's,265.24,5.679,268.0795

boss and now here's the boss he doesn't,270.919,5.161,273.49949999999995
pleased and this beautiful young thing,276.199,5.321,278.8595
on the threshold of life with her eyes,279.44,6.28,282.58
full of dreams of romance and,281.52,4.2,283.62
music no dreams here only tears and not,286.12,7.4,289.82
even room for Tears here only the shame,290.639,5.12,293.199
defeat and his hopes never end,296.28,6.6,299.58
well he can dream cand he oh,302.88,6.599,306.1795

Truth in the old saying that it takes a,344.08,4.399,346.2795
thief To Catch a Thief but there's a lot,345.72,4.8,348.12

to do with the lower part so to keep,2068.56,4.64,2070.88
anything from pushing through my,2071.24,5.359,2073.9195
conscious builds a wall across here call,2073.2,5.52,2075.96
this the sensor,2076.599,5.681,2079.4395
band that don't make,2078.72,3.56,2080.5
sense suppose a guy had those two parts,2083.399,4.081,2085.4395
in his head why doesn't the top part,2085.72,3.56,2087.5
know what the bottom part's doing,2087.48,3.0,2088.98
because it's afraid of what's in the,2089.28,3.96,2091.26
bottom part afraid the bottom part is,2090.48,4.32,2092.64
full of things that the top half wants,2093.24,4.08,2095.2799999999997
to forget things that you you pushed,2094.8,3.92,2096.76
into the lower part when you were a,2097.32,5.4,2100.02
child because they frightened you so,2098.72,6.96,2102.2

trouble you mean that could drive a guy,2122.88,5.199,2125.4795
sometimes can do other things too can,2128.079,5.321,2130.7395

rain rain seems to bother you doesn't it,3018.48,5.359,3021.1595
Walker once had a patient had a curious,3021.2,5.159,3023.7794999999996
dread of the rain used to dream about it,3023.839,4.161,3025.9195
yeah well he must have been a,3026.359,4.841,3028.7795
scrubble you thought he was going mad I,3028.0,5.96,3030.98
fixed him up all,3031.2,2.76,3032.58
right what do you mean you fixed him,3034.96,5.72,3037.82
up I found out what he was really,3038.28,4.72,3040.6400000000003
dreaming about what the rain really,3040.68,4.679,3043.0195
meant in his nightmare he was all right,3043.0,5.0,3045.5
after that you know Walker there's a,3045.359,5.281,3047.9995
meaning to nightmares there are symbols,3048.0,4.599,3050.2995
of something in your subconscious mind,3050.64,3.76,3052.52
the lower half of the sketch I drew for,3052.599,4.76,3054.9790000000003
you and I is everything all right,3054.4,5.04,3056.92

teller they were talking about people,3070.799,5.361,3073.4795
who have the same terrifying dream over,3073.04,6.16,3076.12
and over unless they see a psychiatrist,3076.16,5.32,3078.8199999999997
they sometimes end up by going,3079.2,4.32,3081.3599999999997
insane you mean if they were to come to,3081.48,5.28,3084.12
you you could fix them up in some cases,3083.52,5.92,3086.48
yes suppose they weren't crazy though,3086.76,4.4,3088.96
just ordinary folks who kept having the,3089.44,4.6,3091.7400000000002
same nightmare over and over like a,3091.16,4.6,3093.46
cousin of mine he keeps dreaming the,3094.04,4.44,3096.2599999999998

to deal in human lives mine for instance,3570.839,5.72,3573.699

thought doesn't come to you in any,3704.599,3.121,3706.1595
ordinary way it comes disguised as a,3705.839,5.561,3708.6195
dream he's trying to scare shut,3707.72,3.68,3709.56
everything in your nightmare is a,3715.16,4.36,3717.3399999999997
substitute for something else the rain,3716.68,4.52,3718.94

late what do you mean too late you're,4639.76,3.84,4641.68
cured you know now every time you kill,4641.52,3.92,4643.4800000000005
you're murdering your father so what,4643.6,4.0,4645.6
you'll never kill another man you can't,4645.44,4.239,4647.559499999999
so I can't kill anyone huh every guy I,4647.6,3.92,4649.56
kill is my old man huh well if they were,4649.679,3.441,4651.3995
all my old man it'd be a pleasure oh,4651.52,5.27,4654.155000000001
don't do it don't go watch the fireworks,4653.12,7.16,4656.7
Professor just to make sure get,4660.28,11.429,4665.9945
don't be a fool Walker you can't make it,4681.6,4.03,4683.615000000001
going all stay,4694.88,3.6,4696.68
Walker would never kill,4769.48,5.28,4772.12
again with proper attention earlier in,4771.96,4.56,4774.24
life perhaps he would never have killed,4774.76,5.6,4777.56
at all only it was too,4776.52,7.48,4780.26
late well that's the story of Al,4780.36,7.4,4784.0599999999995
Walker do we want Laro ending the same,4784.0,7.84,4787.92
way not all deformities are visible,4787.76,6.919,4791.2195
Williams put the boy in an institution,4791.84,5.28,4794.4800000000005
give him psychiatric treatment I don't,4794.679,4.211,4796.7845
think he'll ever be another Al,4797.12,3.24,4798.74
Walker okay doc I'll go along with you I,4800.36,4.27,4802.495
guess it's worth a,4802.8,4.75,4805.175
try there with very little difference in,4811.96,5.199,4814.5595
the basic human equation goes any one of,4815.0,6.04,4818.02
us or our kids which one ends up an Al,4817.159,6.0,4820.159
Walker and which one gets a chance to,4821.04,5.44,4823.76
come out a decent member of society may,4823.159,6.721,4826.519499999999
very largely be up to us all some of,4826.48,5.62,4829.29
them need is a,4829.88,6.279,4833.0195
break little understanding and,4836.159,6.48,4839.398999999999
guidance maybe we can salvage some of,4840.04,3.56,4841.82

what our rights are and so would a judge,967.32,3.6,969.12

anything until we've talked to a lawyer,1150.2,4.44,1152.42
well how do you like that,1152.12,6.08,1155.1599999999999

no idea Rusty it's hard to believe she,1164.84,4.26,1166.97
could have done such a thing oh you,1167.539,3.301,1169.1895
didn't I know she didn't,1169.1,3.78,1170.99
those guys are crazy,1170.84,4.5,1173.09
you better have a lemon drop good for,1172.88,3.86,1174.8100000000002
the nerves,1175.34,3.36,1177.02
send them in,1176.74,5.16,1179.32
will you go in please,1178.7,3.2,1180.3
well they're not going to get me to say,1183.799,2.701,1185.1495
one word against her let me tell you,1184.94,5.66,1187.77
that right now I knew her too well,1186.5,4.1,1188.55
sorry Rustin,1196.94,4.739,1199.3095
Dr Elliott Mr district attorney thank,1199.1,4.079,1201.1395
you very much for coming over doc not at,1201.679,4.581,1203.9695000000002
all sir sit down will you,1203.179,3.081,1204.7195000000002
I don't think this is going to take us,1209.6,3.06,1211.1299999999999
very long Rusty,1211.1,3.42,1212.81
you told Lieutenant Stevenson that you,1212.66,3.54,1214.43
saw Dr Peralta and the girl at the,1214.52,3.539,1216.2895
magazine stand talking and apparently,1216.2,3.96,1218.18
arguing on the morning of the day Dr,1218.059,5.401,1220.7595
Peralta was killed that right uh yes sir,1220.16,7.1,1223.71
can you tell me which girl that was,1223.46,3.8,1225.3600000000001
no sir you're sure of that well I didn't,1228.559,6.681,1231.8995
know that there were two of them,1231.62,3.62,1233.4299999999998
quite a coincidence doctor,1236.299,3.26,1237.929
Scott Elliott psychologist b-a-m-d and,1243.26,5.22,1245.87
PhD author of twins a clinical study,1246.08,4.86,1248.51
mental traits of identical twins twins,1248.48,4.62,1250.79
and siblings all published by the State,1250.94,4.5,1253.19
University press your own particular,1253.1,4.62,1255.4099999999999
field in fact well I have devoted quite,1255.44,4.44,1257.66
some time and studied the subject,1257.72,3.66,1259.55
did you know there were twins in this,1259.88,2.52,1261.14
no one at a time twins look a good deal,1262.4,6.0,1265.4
like like Singletons incidentally is,1265.4,4.56,1267.68
there any foundation for the old popular,1268.4,4.5,1270.65
belief the twins are usually penalized,1269.96,5.88,1272.9
in some way by Nature either physically,1272.9,5.519,1275.6595
or psychically no no that's a,1275.84,4.38,1278.03
superstition,1278.419,4.14,1280.489
well that clears that up,1280.22,4.319,1282.3795
lieuten Stevenson reports that you had,1282.559,3.901,1284.5095
some kind of conversation with Dr perala,1284.539,3.601,1286.3395
that morning would you mind repeating,1286.46,3.599,1288.2595000000001
what was said,1288.14,3.84,1290.0600000000002
he asked me if I'd ever come across a,1290.059,5.161,1292.6395
case of split personality go on,1291.98,5.46,1294.71
of course I told him I had,1295.22,4.02,1297.23
then he asked if there was ever any,1297.44,3.78,1299.3300000000002
danger in such a case,1299.24,3.66,1301.07
use the word Danger,1301.22,4.02,1303.23
yes or if I thought all that kind of,1302.9,4.56,1305.18
thing was exaggerated to which you,1305.24,5.34,1307.91
replied I told him I couldn't say,1307.46,4.44,1309.68
well I couldn't answer him with the,1310.58,2.82,1311.99
generality when it was obvious he had,1311.9,3.54,1313.67
something specific in mind,1313.4,5.519,1316.1595
then he said something uh oh I had a,1315.44,4.859,1317.8695
battle with her this morning and I'm,1318.919,4.441,1321.1395
seeing her tonight it's rather important,1320.299,5.961,1323.2794999999999
and we separated,1323.36,2.9,1324.81
seeing home tonight,1327.32,4.32,1329.48
Miss Collins I supposed,1329.179,5.24,1331.799
I have no idea,1336.14,4.62,1338.45
well then can you tell me now which one,1338.6,3.72,1340.4599999999998
of these girls was behind the counter,1340.76,3.98,1342.75
that morning,1342.32,2.42,1343.53
that's all thank you very much ladies,1346.64,3.419,1348.3495
and gentlemen for helping us out here,1348.799,4.74,1351.1689999999999
this morning thank you thank you take,1350.059,6.801,1353.4595
the girls outside for a moment,1353.539,3.321,1355.1995
you're going to let them get away with,1363.62,3.299,1365.2694999999999
it what else can I do Lieutenant you,1365.179,3.301,1366.8295
having a witness that can tell one girl,1366.919,2.581,1368.2095000000002
from the other,1368.48,2.88,1369.92
I wouldn't have a ghost of a chance in,1369.5,3.96,1371.48
court a kid just out of law school could,1371.36,3.48,1373.1
make a monkey out of me with a setup,1373.46,3.06,1374.99
like that I couldn't even get an,1374.84,3.42,1376.55
indictment from the grand jury they'd,1376.52,4.08,1378.56
want to know which one too but one of,1378.26,3.96,1380.24
them murdered him you know I'm sure with,1380.6,3.0,1382.1
you tell me which one and I'll put her,1382.22,2.4,1383.42
in the chair,1383.6,2.819,1385.0095
I have just as much concern for the,1384.62,3.12,1386.1799999999998
proper operation of the law as you,1386.419,3.061,1387.9495000000002
lieutenant but in this case we're,1387.74,2.76,1389.1200000000001
if you have no more evidence then you've,1390.5,3.48,1392.24
shown me it would simply be a waste of,1392.12,3.66,1393.9499999999998
time to try to take it into court,1393.98,6.079,1397.0195
okay let's have them back,1395.78,4.279,1397.9195
you've killed a man In Cold Blood,1418.039,4.38,1420.229
the other is an accomplice,1420.5,3.9,1422.45
but the law upholds your refusal to give,1422.419,4.5,1424.669
any testimony out of the circumstances,1424.4,4.44,1426.6200000000001
it also forbids the indiscriminate,1426.919,4.441,1429.1395
prosecution of more than one person in,1428.84,4.319,1430.9995
order to make sure of one guilty one,1431.36,4.38,1433.55
this protection now enables you to,1433.159,5.161,1435.7395000000001
become parties to an outrageous and,1435.74,5.1,1438.29
shameful miscarriage of Justice,1438.32,4.979,1440.8094999999998
I have no words adequate to express my,1440.84,5.04,1443.36
contempt and abhorrence for both of you,1443.299,4.921,1445.7595
now get out,1445.88,4.44,1448.1000000000001
we're free,1448.22,4.819,1450.6295
you're free,1450.32,2.719,1451.6795
goodbye lieutenant,1456.44,5.84,1459.3600000000001
all about Miss Collins,1458.9,3.38,1460.5900000000001

come on in,1483.64,3.36,1485.3200000000002
sorry snooky I don't mind Ordinary music,1488.02,5.44,1490.74
it's the wonderful stuff that bores me,1491.059,4.86,1493.489
that's snobbish you know well this is an,1493.46,4.28,1495.6000000000001
ordinary place where the gimmicks,1495.919,4.201,1498.0195
gimmicks don't you which doctors treat,1497.74,4.36,1499.92
people with Tinker Toys,1500.12,3.72,1501.9799999999998
they're in the laboratory at the,1502.1,3.66,1503.9299999999998
University what about that office you,1503.84,3.6,1505.6399999999999
keep at the medical building there's a,1505.76,3.96,1507.74
convenient place to get case histories I,1507.44,4.32,1509.6000000000001
don't practice really well you have a,1509.72,4.92,1512.18
lemon drop oh no thanks sit down,1511.76,5.6,1514.56
ever given any thought to this twin case,1519.08,6.12,1522.1399999999999
I suppose you'd given that one up,1523.159,3.9,1525.1090000000002
not me personally this is on my own time,1528.38,5.7,1531.23
you don't look ambitious,1531.5,4.679,1533.8395
it's not ambition I'm just peculiar I,1534.08,3.78,1535.97
don't like a perfect crime not even in,1536.179,3.6,1537.979
books I don't like to think things are,1537.86,3.48,1539.6
organized that way so somebody can beat,1539.779,4.14,1541.849
a square rep,1541.34,4.86,1543.77
yes I've thought about it,1543.919,4.74,1546.289
I'd rather like those girls or one of,1546.2,4.5,1548.45
them anyway she seemed very nice,1548.659,3.781,1550.5495
you don't know which one,1550.7,4.8,1553.1000000000001
no I'm afraid not I never had a chance,1552.44,4.979,1554.9295
to talk to them together you think you'd,1555.5,3.12,1557.06
know if you did,1557.419,3.721,1559.2795
I imagine so you couldn't tell that day,1558.62,4.58,1560.9099999999999
in the DA's office could you,1561.14,6.12,1564.2
no you see,1563.2,6.28,1566.3400000000001
the whole thing just burns me to a crisp,1567.26,4.44,1569.48
why how do you know somebody else didn't,1569.48,4.079,1571.5195
do it I don't in the meantime I'll play,1571.7,3.359,1573.3795
along with the twins at least one of,1573.559,3.48,1575.299
them do you realize doc that one of,1575.059,3.72,1576.9189999999999
those girls could knock that guy off in,1577.039,3.12,1578.599
the corner of broaden Maine with 50,1578.779,3.241,1580.3995
Witnesses and we still couldn't hang it,1580.159,3.12,1581.719
oh I guess not,1583.279,4.02,1585.289
I could be in that room myself and see,1585.08,3.9,1587.03
her plant that knife with my own eyes,1587.299,3.541,1589.0695
and you know I couldn't make it stick,1588.98,3.42,1590.69
unless I grabbed her by the wrist and,1590.84,2.88,1592.28
held onto her until I had her in,1592.4,2.46,1593.63
I just can't bear it I tell you I can't,1594.86,3.48,1596.6
so so first tell me this,1598.34,5.939,1601.3094999999998
you're a twin expert do you know,1601.82,5.04,1604.34
anything whatever about those two Dames,1604.279,4.441,1606.4995
that would give me a chance to begin to,1606.86,2.76,1608.24
for sure what,1609.62,3.419,1611.3294999999998
the crime well of course you don't,1613.039,4.02,1615.049
suppose just anyone could commit a,1615.62,3.659,1617.4495
murder to you,1617.059,4.201,1619.1595
you're going to have to be very patient,1619.279,4.561,1621.5595
with me just what do you mean by that,1621.26,5.22,1623.87
character personality,1623.84,4.56,1626.12
not even nature can duplicate character,1626.48,3.48,1628.22
even in twins,1628.4,3.42,1630.1100000000001
I interviewed a pair of twins one time,1629.96,3.78,1631.8500000000001
so I like that dogs get mixed up about,1631.82,4.62,1634.1299999999999
them once living a thousand miles apart,1633.74,4.86,1636.17
they both got toothaches in the same,1636.44,4.619,1638.7495000000001
tooth and each one had that tooth pulled,1638.6,3.24,1640.2199999999998
do you know why they were living that,1641.84,3.839,1643.7595
far apart why,1643.34,4.26,1645.47
because one was lecturing at a big,1645.679,4.321,1647.8395
Eastern University and the other was,1647.6,4.92,1650.06
serving a stretch in Leavenworth,1650.0,4.38,1652.19
different characters,1652.52,3.84,1654.44
well that's the uh what's the same here,1656.36,4.319,1658.5194999999999
I should say if you're right about these,1659.0,3.96,1660.98
girls one could one couldn't commit,1660.679,4.62,1662.989
murder and well that's all there is to,1662.96,3.719,1664.8195
yeah that's all there is to it,1666.679,5.761,1669.5595
constitutional rights,1669.34,4.48,1671.58
another thing,1673.82,4.02,1675.83
you often interview twins,1675.62,3.419,1677.3294999999998
but not for the police,1679.039,6.02,1682.049
what about the one you've liked,1681.679,3.38,1683.3690000000001
what about it I suppose she's innocent,1685.1,5.24,1687.7199999999998
there's no particular reason to believe,1690.38,4.86,1692.8100000000002
she's in any danger that's what you mean,1691.94,5.51,1694.6950000000002
living with a killer,1695.24,5.34,1697.91
it's really not my business that kind of,1700.58,2.459,1701.8094999999998
one of them kills that way with a knife,1703.039,4.441,1705.2595
don't you think there's a chance she'd,1705.86,4.02,1707.87
kill again her sister if she ever became,1707.48,4.5,1709.73
nervous about it doubt about it I'll,1709.88,4.32,1712.0400000000002
never ask you the name or proof I'll bet,1711.98,4.62,1714.29
not I swear it on anything you say,1714.2,4.62,1716.51
someday you call me and say you found,1716.6,4.319,1718.7595
the answer and I'll be Satisfied why,1718.82,4.14,1720.8899999999999
I've already told you because then I'll,1720.919,3.841,1722.8395
know there's still no such thing as a,1722.96,4.199,1725.0595
perfect crime the system worked you,1724.76,5.63,1727.575
still can't beat a square rap,1727.159,7.62,1730.969
social regulator is that your name for,1734.779,5.121,1737.3395
well it's hard to question the whole,1740.779,5.101,1743.3295
idea I'm not a detective and there's no,1743.179,4.261,1745.3095
reason whatever to assume either be of,1745.88,3.179,1747.4695000000002
the slightest help to her,1747.44,3.96,1749.42
besides I didn't say I was in love with,1749.059,3.24,1750.6789999999999
simply said I liked her,1752.299,3.781,1754.1895
but how do I know she wasn't the one who,1754.46,2.76,1755.8400000000001
and look at a person and tell a thing,1757.22,3.3,1758.8700000000001
like that for all I know she may have,1758.659,3.841,1760.5795
been killing people for years both of,1760.52,3.0,1762.02
all I said was that she was very,1763.52,5.879,1766.4595
pleasant very nice and it's,1766.34,7.04,1769.86
it's not easy to believe that,1769.399,3.981,1771.3895
I missed a lemon drops well it couldn't,1778.58,6.36,1781.76
be anybody but Terry oh you're dark glad,1782.6,4.079,1784.6395
to see you thanks you two are here,1784.94,4.38,1787.13
thanks still chomping on that cast iron,1786.679,5.48,1789.419
candy I've told you before I don't jump,1789.32,6.5,1792.57
I wear them down,1792.159,3.661,1793.9895000000001
well no wonder I never got it didn't you,1797.84,5.339,1800.5095
really an expert like you no obviously,1800.36,5.16,1802.9399999999998
you were both wonderful I'd almost,1803.179,3.901,1805.1295
forgotten there was such a thing as,1805.52,4.32,1807.68
kidding things haven't been so good eh,1807.08,4.319,1809.2395
not so good,1809.84,4.199,1811.9395
who saw the papers those pictures were,1811.399,5.221,1814.0095
celebrities now no work you mean one,1814.039,4.62,1816.349
look at our face and they don't forget,1816.62,5.159,1819.1995
not in this town it's a little rugged,1818.659,5.4,1821.3590000000002
well you can't blame them you saw what,1821.779,4.321,1823.9395
the district attorney said I wish you,1824.059,3.961,1826.0394999999999
wouldn't say things like that,1826.1,3.78,1827.99
he knows he must have read the papers,1828.02,4.8,1830.42
everybody else did I know but well then,1829.88,5.519,1832.6395
maybe my idea that is the real reason,1832.82,4.859,1835.2495
why I'm here maybe you're some good to,1835.399,4.921,1837.8594999999998
you as well as me how do you mean,1837.679,4.441,1839.8995
well I'd like to add you two to my,1840.32,3.12,1841.8799999999999
collection,1842.12,3.299,1843.7694999999999
twins well I'm the old twin student,1843.44,4.5,1845.69
remember and I'd like very much to add,1845.419,4.561,1847.6995000000002
you girls to it well I pay you something,1847.94,4.38,1850.13
of course not much but it'll only be an,1849.98,3.6,1851.78
hour or so each day at your own,1852.32,3.719,1854.1795
convenience we did that once when we,1853.58,4.26,1855.71
were kids in Chicago well then you know,1856.039,4.02,1858.049
generally what it is physical verbal,1857.84,4.68,1860.1799999999998
psychological to standard stuff are you,1860.059,3.961,1862.0394999999999
quite sure you're not doing this for the,1862.52,4.019,1864.5294999999999
police I was gathering data on twins,1864.02,5.039,1866.5395
before I ever met a policeman I was,1866.539,4.26,1868.669
doing it long before I laid eyes on,1869.059,3.84,1870.979
either of you girls what's been my main,1870.799,4.801,1873.1995
preoccupation in research for years and,1872.899,4.26,1875.029
I'll probably still be doing it after,1875.6,3.299,1877.2495
you're both married and settled down,1877.159,3.74,1879.029
with twins of your own,1878.899,4.201,1880.9995
which you're very likely to have you,1880.899,4.301,1883.0494999999999
know what exactly is your purpose in,1883.1,4.439,1885.3194999999998
this the purpose of all research to,1885.2,3.9,1887.15
learn as much as possible about the,1887.539,3.601,1889.3395
subject in this case to add to my,1889.1,3.959,1891.0794999999998
knowledge of identical twins and you'd,1891.14,6.3,1894.2900000000002
pay us 25 a week a piece well that's the,1893.059,6.72,1896.4189999999999
customary allowance and for that I'd,1897.44,3.959,1899.4195
expect you to come to the laboratory at,1899.779,4.321,1901.9395
least three times a week separately for,1901.399,5.101,1903.9495
not more than no two hours anyway on,1904.1,3.9,1906.05
each visit,1906.5,3.36,1908.18
what are you saying,1908.0,3.899,1909.9495
I don't think we're interested I don't,1909.86,4.14,1911.9299999999998
like the idea of being a guinea pig,1911.899,4.02,1913.9089999999999
and I don't want to press you if you're,1914.0,4.08,1916.04
afraid in any way we have nothing to be,1915.919,3.781,1917.8095
afraid of doctor,1918.08,4.459,1920.3094999999998
nothing but snooze,1919.7,2.839,1921.1195
in that case there's nothing more to be,1922.88,3.539,1924.6495000000002
I'm sorry if I've given that impression,1926.419,5.64,1929.239
and I apologize I'm sorry too I think we,1928.399,6.061,1931.4295
should do it,1932.059,4.201,1934.1595
I don't think Dr Elliott's a snooper and,1934.46,3.0,1935.96
I know of no other reason why we,1936.26,2.46,1937.49
shouldn't we could certainly use the,1937.46,2.52,1938.72
you don't mind being asked a lot of,1939.98,5.16,1942.56
personal questions why should I,1942.02,5.7,1944.87
or why should you if it's for a good,1945.14,3.539,1946.9095000000002
I think we should do it because there's,1948.679,3.901,1950.6295
no reason for us to fear it because we,1950.96,4.8,1953.3600000000001
do need the money and because well we've,1952.58,6.36,1955.76
always liked Dr Elliot both of us,1955.76,5.279,1958.3995
well then let's leave it like this talk,1958.94,4.68,1961.28
it over between yourselves and call me I,1961.039,4.62,1963.349
hope you can see things Terry's way but,1963.62,3.96,1965.6
if you can't I'll understand and no harm,1965.659,4.981,1968.1495000000002
done goodbye now goodbye goodbye Terry I,1967.58,4.38,1969.77
hope I'll be seeing you both soon,1970.64,3.419,1972.3495

are you afraid of I'm not afraid it's,1990.919,5.461,1993.6495
don't lie about it you are afraid you're,1993.799,4.801,1996.1995
more and more afraid every day why,1996.38,5.1,1998.93
Tara you know very well what it is,1998.6,5.04,2001.12
I think I killed him why don't you admit,2001.48,2.88,2002.92
but don't you no I don't then why are,2004.36,4.679,2006.6995
you so frightened Terry if they knew,2007.12,3.659,2008.9495
which was in his apartment that night,2009.039,3.721,2010.8995
you know what that would mean,2010.779,4.801,2013.1795
he proposed to me there and I said yes,2012.76,6.299,2015.9095
why should I kill him I know that dear I,2015.58,5.219,2018.1895
know you didn't do it I know it so well,2019.059,3.301,2020.7095
that I'm willing to do anything to keep,2020.799,2.701,2022.1495
them from learning you were in this,2022.36,2.88,2023.8
apartment that night that's the only,2023.5,4.38,2025.69
reason I'm frightened believe me dear,2025.24,4.74,2027.61
please believe,2027.88,3.36,2029.5600000000002
well then is there anything about,2029.98,2.939,2031.4495
yourself that you're afraid for Elliot,2031.24,3.539,2033.0095000000001
of course not,2034.779,4.801,2037.1795
then stop worrying there's no need for,2036.64,3.96,2038.6200000000001
and besides,2040.6,3.48,2042.34
he's very attractive,2042.159,3.721,2044.0195
very good looking,2044.08,4.699,2046.4295
I like him,2045.88,2.899,2047.3295
I even have you spotted at the magazine,2077.56,4.079,2079.5995
stand how do you mean well I know some,2079.359,3.48,2081.0989999999997
of the times when it was you and someone,2081.639,2.641,2082.9595
who was Ruth,2082.839,5.0,2085.339
not all of them cause but some,2084.28,3.559,2086.0595000000003
what was the difference,2088.419,5.22,2091.029
I don't know a meeting I'm not sure yet,2089.919,6.24,2093.0389999999998
which one did you like the best oh you,2093.639,7.041,2097.1595
really sit over here will you,2096.159,4.521,2098.4195
why what why do you say you like me best,2104.02,5.22,2106.63
because that's always the answer during,2107.38,4.58,2109.67
office hours,2109.24,2.72,2110.6
what's this one,2114.94,4.38,2117.13
these are pictures of ink blots actually,2116.68,4.679,2119.0195
the kind you probably made yourself when,2119.32,4.259,2121.4495
you were a child just Blobs of ink in,2121.359,5.161,2123.9395
the paper folded over what's it for,2123.579,4.441,2125.7995
it's another way of examining,2126.52,3.12,2128.08
personality,2128.02,4.2,2130.12
I'm going to hand them to you one by one,2129.64,4.62,2131.95
and all you have to do is tell me what,2132.22,3.24,2133.8399999999997
you see there,2134.26,3.54,2136.03
what it looks like to you,2135.46,5.82,2138.37
quickly if you see it quickly sure as,2137.8,4.74,2140.17
soon as you make something out of it you,2141.28,4.92,2143.7400000000002
tell me that's all you ready,2142.54,5.39,2145.235
a face that way please,2146.2,4.83,2148.615
what does it look like to you,2151.359,5.581,2154.1495
might be a mask you see,2154.06,5.1,2156.61
the black slanting holes For Eyes heavy,2156.94,4.139,2159.0095
eyebrows and purse lips give it a fixed,2159.16,3.0,2160.66
expression,2161.079,3.061,2162.6095
anything else,2162.16,5.84,2165.08
may I turn it any way you wish,2164.14,3.86,2166.0699999999997
this looks like the face of a white Lamb,2169.2,4.48,2171.4399999999996
with a black nose,2171.88,4.26,2174.01
it's got a mark on its forehead it looks,2173.68,4.5,2175.93
like a moth spreading its wings over a,2176.14,4.56,2178.42
butterfly beneath its front paws are two,2178.18,5.34,2180.85
men face down with their arms,2180.7,4.8,2183.1
outstretched it all seems symbolic of,2183.52,3.9,2185.47
something the lamb looks so innocent but,2185.5,4.02,2187.51
it has two men under its paws,2187.42,5.24,2190.04
symbolic of what,2189.52,3.14,2191.09
the Lamb of death,2193.0,3.02,2194.51
I wonder if your really as cool as you,2197.98,5.099,2200.5295
pretend oh no I'm not I don't think so,2200.26,5.52,2203.0200000000004
either outside the office I'm Robert,2203.079,5.52,2205.8390000000004
Taylor with jet propulsion what do you,2205.78,5.36,2208.46
see in this one,2208.599,2.541,2209.8695000000002
what does it look like to you Terry,2213.22,6.24,2216.3399999999997
these are two men back to back but they,2216.22,5.46,2218.95
don't seem to be aware of each other,2219.46,4.44,2221.68
now it's changing into the full face of,2221.68,3.659,2223.5094999999997
a man with grouping mustache and,2223.9,3.78,2225.79
slanting eyes,2225.339,4.621,2227.6495
and this is a Dancer a woman dancing,2227.68,3.78,2229.5699999999997
with a puppet,2229.96,3.72,2231.82
now you see the puppet reaching to Pat a,2231.46,4.08,2233.5
cruel rival that pretends not to see her,2233.68,3.72,2235.54
but all the time he's trying to reach,2235.54,3.9,2237.49
near enough to do her some harm,2237.4,5.6,2240.2000000000003
may I have a cigarette please,2239.44,3.56,2241.2200000000003
by the way why'd you leave Nebraska Ruth,2255.46,5.76,2258.34
well we've been living on this farm for,2259.119,4.321,2261.2795
about a year and the farmer's wife want,2261.22,4.74,2263.5899999999997
to adopt me legally the doctor said she,2263.44,4.26,2265.57
couldn't have any children but they,2265.96,4.08,2268.0
could only afford to adopt one of us,2267.7,4.08,2269.74
why'd they pick you instead of tear it,2270.04,2.64,2271.36
oh just happened I suppose no particular,2272.68,4.14,2274.75
reason there's not much choice between,2275.44,3.899,2277.3895
Twins you know but Terry was very upset,2276.82,4.56,2279.1000000000004
when she heard about it naturally so we,2279.339,5.601,2282.1394999999998
just decided to pull out that's all,2281.38,3.56,2283.1600000000003
what do you see in this one,2285.22,4.859,2287.6495
well these are two people in costume and,2290.079,4.861,2292.5095
they're dancing around a maypole and,2292.96,3.06,2294.4900000000002
they're bending over because they've,2294.94,3.6,2296.7400000000002
just about wound up the ribbons is that,2296.02,4.68,2298.36
what you want that's it,2298.54,3.78,2300.43
anything else,2300.7,4.22,2302.81
turn it if you wish,2302.32,6.24,2305.44
oh these are two skaters like in the ice,2308.56,5.58,2311.35
show and they're leaning backward one,2311.44,4.2,2313.54
foot high in the air and their arms,2314.14,2.84,2315.56
uh how did Terry find out you know yeah,2320.38,6.36,2323.56
oh the farmer I think he never liked it,2323.76,5.38,2326.4500000000003
from the beginning for some reason,2326.74,5.4,2329.4399999999996
is he cranky no I got along fine with,2329.14,5.88,2332.08
him but Terry for some reason what do,2332.14,4.74,2334.5099999999998
you see in this one,2335.02,3.96,2337.0
oh these are two old ladies sitting back,2336.88,4.44,2339.1
to back in a in an open street car like,2338.98,4.56,2341.26
the old cable cars in San Francisco and,2341.32,4.62,2343.63
they seem frightened they've got they're,2343.54,4.2,2345.64
holding on to their arms of their chairs,2345.94,3.0,2347.44
with their hands they've got their feet,2347.74,3.66,2349.5699999999997
tucked tightly under their seats oh look,2348.94,3.39,2350.635
at those chins,2351.4,2.219,2352.5095
and this is a drum majorette with a high,2353.619,5.181,2356.2095
bare skin Shaco and she's very stray,2355.72,6.96,2359.2
graceful light-footed and she's got her,2358.8,5.42,2361.51
knee high in the air,2362.68,3.56,2364.46
thank you very much,2366.24,3.54,2368.0099999999998
it's about,2372.52,2.54,2373.79
what'd you do go through town no Scott,2376.72,6.26,2379.85
and I just got to talking,2379.9,6.06,2382.9300000000003
after that inkblood stuff who do you,2382.98,4.84,2385.4
suppose ever thought that went up,2385.96,5.28,2388.6
talking about plot oh just gabbing,2387.82,7.74,2391.69
Chicago movies when we were kids,2391.24,7.859,2395.1695
not about us no mostly by himself,2395.56,5.34,2398.23
it was really awfully funny about when,2399.099,4.74,2401.469
he went to school he must have been he,2400.9,5.459,2403.6295
was really once he drops that office act,2403.839,4.561,2406.1195
he's really an awful lot of fun the way,2406.359,3.361,2408.0395
he used to be around the cigar stand,2408.4,3.54,2410.17
remember is that his line down memory,2409.72,4.56,2412.0
lane I don't think it was a line he just,2411.94,3.899,2413.8895
seemed to want to talk that's all,2414.28,3.6,2416.0800000000004
nothing romantic,2415.839,3.961,2417.8195
I'm afraid not,2417.88,6.54,2421.15
dear me you sound disappointed no,2419.8,7.68,2423.6400000000003
not falling for him are you my goodness,2424.42,4.8,2426.82
Terry sometimes it seems as if that were,2427.48,3.24,2429.1
all you ever thought about falling for,2429.22,3.119,2430.7794999999996
somebody of course not,2430.72,3.06,2432.25
just don't want to see you do anything,2432.339,5.041,2434.8595
foolish that's all yes Mama,2433.78,5.52,2436.5400000000004
I'm not convinced yet that he's been,2437.38,3.6,2439.1800000000003
strictly on the level with us in this,2439.3,3.86,2441.23
well I don't know of course,2443.68,3.14,2445.25
and believe it or perhaps not but if I,2447.28,6.0,2450.28
were you I'd be just a little careful,2451.24,6.02,2454.25
not too friendly yeah,2453.28,3.98,2455.27
if only we weren't so I know it's not,2458.92,4.439,2461.1395
very pleasant,2462.04,3.059,2463.5695
but as long as we are we'll just have to,2463.359,4.821,2465.7695
be on our guard with everybody,2465.099,3.081,2466.6395
well it's something I hadn't figured on,2506.38,4.62,2508.69
never even dreamed of well I'm not going,2508.3,4.2,2510.4
to ask any questions I said I wouldn't,2511.0,4.14,2513.07
and I won't all I can do is stand here a,2512.5,4.5,2514.75
poor broken down old policeman and wait,2515.14,4.08,2517.18
for whatever you want to tell me,2517.0,4.46,2519.23
but you know the ink blood test,2519.22,4.619,2521.5294999999996
I've made several other kinds of tests,2521.46,4.899,2523.9095
to check and cross-check but in the ink,2523.839,4.74,2526.209
black test about 80 of the people who,2526.359,3.961,2528.3395
study the blots will see generally the,2528.579,3.601,2530.3795
same figures the same Illusions and,2530.32,2.94,2531.79
what the other 20 see in the same blots,2533.26,4.859,2535.6895000000004
reflecting the true secret patterns of,2535.619,4.96,2538.099
their own minds and personalities,2538.119,4.021,2540.1295
it's quite Illuminating and pretty,2540.579,4.381,2542.7695000000003
accurate in this particular case there,2542.14,4.199,2544.2394999999997
doesn't seem to be much room for doubt,2544.96,4.139,2547.0295
about one thing what,2546.339,5.481,2549.0795
one of our young ladies is insane,2549.099,6.561,2552.3795
very clever very intelligent but insane,2551.82,7.28,2555.46
now this one's called a free association,2560.5,4.38,2562.69
test and it's so simple that even I,2562.599,3.961,2564.5795000000003
understand what I'm doing look if all,2564.88,3.12,2566.44
this is to find out which of us is,2566.56,3.059,2568.0895
smarter I can save you a lot of time,2568.0,4.32,2570.16
it's Terry is that official you know,2569.619,4.5,2571.869
it's a funny thing about us I'm older,2572.32,4.5,2574.57
than she is 7 minutes and 55 seconds but,2574.119,4.801,2576.5195000000003
that isn't the way it feels all our,2576.82,3.6,2578.6200000000003
lives she's been the oldest sister,2578.92,4.38,2581.11
always helping and protecting me sit,2580.42,4.26,2582.55
over there please,2583.3,3.42,2585.01
and like a mother too actually because,2584.68,5.1,2587.23
we've been orphaned since we were 10.,2586.72,4.74,2589.0899999999997
I wish you'd get it out of your head,2589.78,3.24,2591.4
that this is a contest,2591.46,3.42,2593.17
I'm interested in absolute not,2593.02,6.319,2596.1795
comparative results yes professor,2594.88,4.459,2597.1095
you know something what,2599.68,4.919,2602.1394999999998
I'm a very pleased man today good which,2601.78,6.96,2605.26
I haven't been for uh almost a week no,2604.599,6.48,2607.839
because you haven't seemed happy,2608.74,4.079,2610.7794999999996
I was afraid I'd done something that,2612.819,3.481,2614.5595
offended you oh,2614.38,4.34,2616.55
I didn't mean to I assure you,2616.3,4.74,2618.67
it was something else,2618.72,5.46,2621.45
I was a little worried,2621.04,3.14,2622.61
but it's all right now yes it's okay now,2624.28,7.079,2627.8195
good that's the way it ought to be,2627.88,6.719,2631.2395
well uh back to cold science,2631.359,5.401,2634.0595
I'm going to give you some words one at,2634.599,3.0,2636.099
and as soon as you hear the word you,2637.599,2.821,2639.0095
answer with the first word that comes,2639.099,3.181,2640.6895
into your mind not a sentence just a,2640.42,4.199,2642.5195
single word an answer as quickly as you,2642.28,3.839,2644.1995
can that's the important part of it,2644.619,4.041,2646.6395
ready mm-hmm,2649.06,3.779,2650.9495
Dark Night,2656.319,5.461,2659.0495
Moon beans,2659.14,6.02,2662.15
knife scissors,2661.78,3.38,2663.4700000000003
white black,2665.38,5.9,2668.33
never death,2667.78,3.5,2669.53
Blossom flower,2679.119,7.281,2682.7595
brother Lake,2682.44,3.96,2684.42
but how could you have said it,2687.099,4.801,2689.4995000000004
how do I know it just popped out,2689.079,4.621,2691.3895
but I don't understand all this fuss,2691.9,4.199,2693.9995
what possible harm can it do,2693.7,3.72,2695.56
none whatever,2697.42,3.48,2699.16
I don't give two cents for that fellow,2698.92,4.38,2701.11
in his kindergarten games,2700.9,4.62,2703.21
I can do that stuff 24 hours a day seven,2703.3,3.6,2705.1000000000004
days a week and beat him at it every,2705.52,2.7,2706.87
time he doesn't frighten me with that,2706.9,3.24,2708.52
but it's you I'm worried about,2710.14,3.439,2711.8595
it shows your mind still on that thing,2714.4,3.419,2716.1095
and you can't deny it when he said,2715.96,3.54,2717.73
mirror and you automatically said death,2717.819,3.601,2719.6195
that proved it it may not mean a thing,2719.5,3.18,2721.09
to him but it does to me because I,2721.42,2.88,2722.86
understand some of that mumbo jumbo and,2722.68,3.24,2724.2999999999997
it's a dead giveaway that it's still in,2724.3,2.94,2725.77
your mind and I had something to do with,2725.92,3.5,2727.67
Harry please,2730.78,6.48,2734.02
so I've told you why do you why do you,2732.7,6.6,2736.0
keep saying a thing like that,2737.26,4.559,2739.5395000000003
forget it but you've no right even to,2739.3,4.2,2741.4
why do you take those sleeping pills,2743.5,3.599,2745.2995
every night because I can't sleep,2745.3,4.92,2747.76
without them of course why can't you,2747.099,4.98,2749.589
because my nerves are still bad I,2750.22,4.68,2752.56
haven't gotten over everything yet,2752.079,5.881,2755.0195000000003
neither of us has is that all,2754.9,5.52,2757.6600000000003
what other reason could there be,2757.96,4.859,2760.3895
not your conscience perhaps,2760.42,4.98,2762.91
my conscience about what,2762.819,4.5,2765.069
perhaps you're sorry you didn't tell the,2765.4,4.08,2767.44
police all you know,2767.319,4.5,2769.569
maybe that's what's troubling you,2769.48,4.379,2771.6695
maybe you're thinking you should do it,2771.819,4.561,2774.0995
even now but that's utterly ridiculous,2773.859,4.98,2776.3489999999997
such a thought never ended my head,2776.38,4.38,2778.57
because if you are,2778.839,4.321,2780.9995
there's the phone right there,2780.76,4.98,2783.25
oh Terry stop it you're talking nonsense,2783.16,5.22,2785.77
Emma of course you are,2785.74,5.16,2788.3199999999997
because if you ever suspected me,2790.9,6.48,2794.14
I don't know what I'd do,2794.079,5.161,2796.6595
I really don't,2797.38,11.04,2802.9
moon stars,2810.339,3.721,2812.1994999999997
death Vera,2816.94,3.26,2818.57
I have an idea you aren't very much,2837.7,3.06,2839.23
impressed with any of this stuff,2839.5,4.079,2841.5395
actually are you Terry no then why do,2840.76,5.099,2843.3095000000003
you think I'm here just humoring the old,2843.579,4.921,2846.0395000000003
Professor I imagine at all,2845.859,4.621,2848.1695
oh nothing else to do,2848.5,3.78,2850.39
hadn't it ever occurred to you that I,2850.48,3.18,2852.07
might like seeing you,2852.28,3.96,2854.26
no it hadn't Dude tell the truth don't,2853.66,3.9,2855.6099999999997
you like to see me,2856.24,3.54,2858.0099999999998
if you knew how anxious I was for you to,2857.56,3.66,2859.39
get here this afternoon you wouldn't,2859.78,3.0,2861.28
have to ask that,2861.22,2.879,2862.6594999999998
very honest then maybe we could see each,2864.099,4.621,2866.4095
other outside the office sometime well,2866.619,4.081,2868.6595
we will I'm sure,2868.72,5.28,2871.3599999999997
would you like to very much all right,2870.7,5.34,2873.37
uh but not until we finish with these,2876.04,3.9,2877.99
tests I'm afraid what's that got to do,2878.02,2.94,2879.49
look it's hard enough for me to keep my,2880.96,4.139,2883.0295
mind on science as it is please don't,2882.76,4.859,2885.1895000000004
make it any more difficult for me all,2885.099,4.861,2887.5295
right but the first night afterward it's,2887.619,4.98,2890.109
a date the very next night remember I'll,2889.96,6.2,2893.06
remember Terry good night,2892.599,3.561,2894.3795
I was really crazy about that boy but,2898.619,4.601,2900.9195
Terry simply couldn't stand him she,2901.66,2.88,2903.1
insisted he wasn't on the level and,2903.22,2.7,2904.5699999999997
that's the way it turned out he wasn't,2904.54,3.66,2906.37
how'd you find out he dated her while,2905.92,4.5,2908.17
lighting she told me,2908.2,4.98,2910.6899999999996
Terry's turned in I guess,2910.42,4.56,2912.7000000000003
how many men have you been crazy about,2914.98,4.98,2917.47
oh that was just kid stuff we're about,2917.079,5.401,2919.7795
16 then I think,2919.96,5.52,2922.7200000000003
all the sort of biography I'm giving you,2922.48,5.76,2925.36
is this for science too,2925.48,3.9,2927.43
no this is personal,2929.38,3.9,2931.33
the more I know about you the more I,2931.54,2.819,2932.9495
want to know,2933.28,2.4,2934.48
I want to know everything about you,2934.359,4.861,2936.7895
that's possible to know for myself,2935.68,5.82,2938.5899999999997
and apparently you will,2939.22,4.379,2941.4094999999998
good knife,2941.5,3.96,2943.48
do you think when all this business is,2943.599,3.601,2945.3995
over I can call and ask you out for,2945.46,4.98,2947.95
dinner dancing or just to talk in a,2947.2,4.919,2949.6594999999998
purely personal way,2950.44,4.02,2952.4500000000003
you think you'll still want to that's,2952.119,5.22,2954.7290000000003
what I'm looking forward to,2954.46,4.2,2956.56
you're a one day,2960.339,5.9,2963.2889999999998
good night,2972.76,2.54,2974.03

I'm not asleep,2991.72,5.359,2994.3995
don't turn on the light,2993.819,3.26,2995.449
I'll undress in the bathroom,2997.24,3.32,2998.8999999999996
you're taking a sleeping pill tonight I,3030.92,4.659,3033.2495
don't think so,3034.079,3.78,3035.969
I slept all right last night,3035.579,5.701,3038.4295
I think you better take two two but on,3037.859,5.161,3040.4395
Earth four,3041.28,3.36,3042.96
well if you take two maybe you won't be,3043.02,4.559,3045.2995
so troubled in your sleep,3044.64,6.959,3048.1195
you mean I talk talk cry you scare me,3047.579,7.801,3051.4795000000004
after death sometimes of course yeah,3051.599,7.381,3055.2895000000003
screaming I suppose no,3055.38,5.88,3058.32
you don't remember what you dream,3058.98,4.079,3061.0195
well I don't remember even dreaming,3061.26,2.819,3062.6695000000004
you don't remember my waking you last,3064.079,4.201,3066.1795
night when you were sobbing,3066.0,3.66,3067.83
no what you said to me,3069.66,3.26,3071.29
no what'd I say,3073.2,4.859,3075.6295
such big deep sarves as if you were,3075.18,4.86,3077.6099999999997
terrified as if you were seeing,3078.059,3.421,3079.7695000000003
something so Dreadful you couldn't bear,3080.04,3.18,3081.63
to face it,3081.48,4.44,3083.7
you don't remember what it was,3083.22,4.68,3085.56
I don't remember anything about it at,3085.92,2.76,3087.3
but I thought you awakened,3088.68,5.36,3091.3599999999997
no you're hurrying for a few minutes,3094.2,3.2,3095.7999999999997
can't imagine what it was to frighten me,3097.619,4.74,3099.989
so has it happened before,3099.9,4.919,3102.3595
a few times,3102.359,4.561,3104.6394999999998
one night you rather gave her a change,3104.819,4.201,3106.9195
quite gay in fact,3106.92,6.54,3110.19
seems to have been something about Scott,3109.02,4.44,3111.24
you think quite a lot of them don't you,3115.2,5.659,3118.0294999999996
I do like him but,3117.3,3.559,3119.0795000000003
does he like you oh some I imagine,3120.9,6.719,3124.2595
ever say anything,3125.76,4.859,3128.1895000000004
you know nothing serious,3127.619,7.761,3131.4995000000004
just casual things ever kiss you,3130.619,4.761,3132.9995000000004
may be just trying to pump you you know,3136.68,6.32,3139.8399999999997
well I don't think so,3139.559,3.441,3141.2795
don't you want to know what seemed to be,3148.5,4.319,3150.6595
frightening you,3150.54,4.92,3153.0
I don't know whether I do or not,3152.819,4.921,3155.2795
you've talked about it before in your,3155.46,3.0,3156.96
you were worried,3158.46,4.2,3160.56
about one of us being,3160.619,5.22,3163.2290000000003
crazy you're saying you know that one of,3162.66,5.58,3165.45
twins is likely to be abnormal,3165.839,4.201,3167.9395
but that's not true,3168.24,3.839,3170.1594999999998
that's a superstition,3170.04,3.36,3171.72
you heard Scott tell the district,3172.079,4.98,3174.569
attorney that I know,3173.4,6.24,3176.52
oh that's an old wives tale we've heard,3177.059,4.381,3179.2495000000004
it for years both of us but it's not,3179.64,3.6,3181.44
didn't you hear Scott say it wasn't,3183.24,5.16,3185.8199999999997
yes I heard him,3185.64,5.36,3188.3199999999997
oh frightens me,3193.98,4.26,3196.11
the whole idea,3196.319,5.701,3199.1695
talking and dreaming and sobbing and,3198.24,6.3,3201.39
remembering nothing about it,3202.02,4.86,3204.45
Well it can't be very pleasant,3204.54,4.86,3206.97
but it's not really so important,3206.88,5.58,3209.67
just bad dreams,3209.4,5.9,3212.35
what's this one a blood pressure Terry,3252.54,5.16,3255.12
and pulse while we're talking you mean a,3255.119,5.041,3257.6395
lie detector that's an easy name for it,3257.7,5.04,3260.22
do you mind why should I what do you,3260.16,3.959,3262.1394999999998
want me to talk about,3262.74,3.48,3264.4799999999996
I'll let you know when we're ready,3264.119,4.561,3266.3995

I'm afraid I did forget I'm terribly,3288.059,5.04,3290.579
sorry you mean you can't make it,3290.099,6.601,3293.3995
any other night but,3293.099,6.301,3296.2495000000004
what a man and me thinking that you were,3296.7,4.379,3298.8894999999998
simply living for that night,3299.4,3.78,3301.29
what's inexcusable I know but we,3301.079,4.621,3303.3895
finished so much sooner than I expected,3303.18,4.439,3305.3995
who's my rival,3305.7,4.32,3307.8599999999997
you have no rival you know that that,3307.619,3.96,3309.599
always the answer during office hours,3310.02,2.52,3311.28

heart's broken that's all let's have the,3320.04,4.44,3322.2599999999998
machine all I want you to do is answer a,3322.02,4.2,3324.12
few simple questions not on any,3324.48,3.42,3326.19
forbidden subjects you need me worried,3326.22,3.42,3327.93
about that well it's all over the whole,3327.9,5.52,3330.6600000000003
thing ask me anything you wish uh does,3329.64,6.179,3332.7295
that go for Ruth too well that you,3333.42,3.84,3335.34
better ask her,3335.819,4.441,3338.0395
oh yeah yes yes of course,3337.26,5.64,3340.0800000000004
well I hope so anyway you've both been,3340.26,4.62,3342.57
through a pretty terrible ordeal,3342.9,3.54,3344.67
if you've managed to come out of it okay,3344.88,4.38,3347.07
that's that's wonderful well what are,3346.44,4.56,3348.7200000000003
you going to ask me,3349.26,3.24,3350.88
oh you were telling me the other day,3351.0,3.839,3352.9195
about when you lived in Ohio before you,3352.5,4.2,3354.6
moved to Chicago remember,3354.839,3.421,3356.5495
anything else interesting along about,3356.7,4.859,3359.1295
that time no offhand,3358.26,5.04,3360.78
um I believe that Ruth was telling me,3361.559,3.481,3363.2995
about a boy that she went with that you,3363.3,5.039,3365.8195
didn't care very much for,3365.04,5.64,3367.86
or Freddie Eckland,3368.339,6.301,3371.4895
yes I think that was the name in uh in,3370.68,4.98,3373.1699999999996
why what did she say,3375.66,4.26,3377.79
oh she just said that you told her he,3378.18,4.62,3380.49
wasn't on the level and proved it was,3379.92,6.06,3382.9500000000003
she complaining good Heavens no she was,3382.8,4.86,3385.23
grateful you know how she depends on you,3385.98,3.78,3387.87
she was just rambling along about how,3387.66,3.78,3389.5499999999997
you've always looked after her sort of,3389.76,3.72,3391.6200000000003
like an older sister she says,3391.44,4.5,3393.69
she tell you that I knew him first,3393.48,5.46,3396.21
oh I don't believe she did well that's,3395.94,5.34,3398.61
the truth of the matter I met him first,3398.94,4.619,3401.2495
and introduced him to her and he didn't,3401.28,4.079,3403.3195
care in the slightest for her and I knew,3403.559,3.78,3405.449
it and then he started going round with,3405.359,3.841,3407.2795
her without her even dreaming for one,3407.339,3.48,3409.0789999999997
second that it was actually me that he,3409.2,4.28,3411.3399999999997
was interested in,3410.819,2.661,3412.1495
what is it dear that light again,3441.859,8.381,3446.0495
wake up dear you're dreaming again no no,3445.74,6.839,3449.1594999999998
it wasn't a dream didn't you see it,3450.24,4.8,3452.64
there wasn't anything to see dear you're,3452.579,5.04,3455.099
dreaming I'd tell you it wasn't a dream,3455.04,4.98,3457.5299999999997
I wasn't asleep the whole room lighted,3457.619,4.381,3459.8095000000003
up Terry I saw everything in a great,3460.02,5.4,3462.72
fash now you're all right,3462.0,7.52,3465.76
there's nothing to be afraid of,3465.42,4.1,3467.4700000000003
oh but I was sure I saw it,3470.4,4.04,3472.42
it doesn't matter it really doesn't,3474.5,8.92,3478.96
but what is it what do you think it is,3479.339,5.941,3482.3095
because something's happening to me and,3483.42,3.419,3485.1295
I don't know what it is,3485.28,4.14,3487.3500000000004
I don't understand it,3486.839,5.461,3489.5695
just imagining things your nerves are,3489.42,6.12,3492.48
playing little tricks on you that's all,3492.3,5.22,3494.9100000000003
I'm so scared,3495.54,4.53,3497.805
I'm so scared I don't know what to do,3497.52,7.44,3501.24
it's not nothing really,3504.96,3.74,3506.83
just remember I'm with you,3517.22,5.68,3520.06
and I'm always going to be with you,3519.9,6.08,3522.94
no matter what,3522.9,3.08,3524.44
so that's all there is to it,3533.64,6.659,3536.9694999999997
yes that's all there is I'm afraid,3536.88,4.979,3539.3695000000002
I didn't promise you a great deal more,3540.299,3.961,3542.2795
remember all I can say positively is,3541.859,4.621,3544.1695
that Ruth didn't do it she simply isn't,3544.26,3.839,3546.1795
capable of that sort of thing that I,3546.48,4.02,3548.4900000000002
know that does narrow it down a bit,3548.099,5.821,3551.0095
though Terry's a paranoic paranoic has,3550.5,4.92,3552.96
no more conscience no more sense of,3553.92,3.62,3555.73
right and wrong than a two-year-old,3555.42,5.58,3558.21
paranoia is capable of anything,3557.54,5.92,3560.5
that's something but not much you can't,3561.0,4.079,3563.0395
run loonies until they've done something,3563.46,4.32,3565.62
broken some kind of law their families,3565.079,4.321,3567.2395
don't see fit to commit them you just,3567.78,3.559,3569.5595000000003
have to wait till somebody set on fire,3569.4,6.0,3572.4
unfortunately pretty tough on Ruth,3571.339,7.0,3574.839
you got to tell her aren't you,3575.4,5.159,3577.9795
I suppose so but it's not going to be,3578.339,3.72,3580.199
apparently she hasn't the ghost of a,3582.059,3.661,3583.8895
suspicion no,3583.859,4.26,3585.989
what about that double Alibi she could,3585.72,5.04,3588.24
be tricked Terry could trick her,3588.119,5.421,3590.8295000000003
much obliged anyway Duff yeah sorry I,3594.42,4.02,3596.4300000000003
couldn't have been more help to you,3597.48,1.98,3598.47
lieutenant,3598.44,4.619,3600.7495
good night Sergeant good night doc,3599.46,5.52,3602.2200000000003
you gonna see Ruth again soon,3603.059,3.841,3604.9795000000004
I expect to tell her right away no,3604.98,4.02,3606.9900000000002
matter how hard it is I will because,3606.9,3.659,3608.7295
it's six to an even you know the other,3609.0,2.88,3610.44
one's gonna pop off again before it's,3610.559,3.601,3612.3595
over it's quite possible,3611.88,4.08,3613.92
it's better than that and watch out for,3614.16,3.06,3615.69
yourself too,3615.96,3.359,3617.6395
oh I don't think I figure very seriously,3617.22,3.54,3618.99
in our calculations,3619.319,3.841,3621.2395
she didn't mind these tests maybe just,3620.76,4.079,3622.7995
another challenge to her another,3623.16,3.12,3624.72
opportunity to show the world what,3624.839,3.841,3626.7595
contempt she has for it that was the,3626.28,4.74,3628.65
first tip off I got on it thought you,3628.68,3.6,3630.48
said there was no pattern to a,3631.02,4.02,3633.03
psychotics calculations well don't be,3632.28,4.799,3634.6795
too modestoc,3635.04,6.079,3638.0795
all right I'll tell her when,3637.079,4.04,3639.099
tonight tonight if I can,3641.339,6.26,3644.469
good night good night,3644.04,3.559,3645.8195
you know it might help if Terry came out,3650.099,4.381,3652.2895000000003
and spit on the sidewalk or something,3652.619,5.041,3655.1395
then we could pick her up,3654.48,5.099,3657.0295
if I was that young man I'd feel a,3657.66,4.5,3659.91
trifle nervous yeah why because from the,3659.579,4.081,3661.6195000000002
way he tells it whether he knows it or,3662.16,3.419,3663.8695
not he looks very much to me like the,3663.66,4.199,3665.7594999999997
new Peralta Target for the night huh,3665.579,5.161,3668.1595
uh-huh that's the way it is you know the,3667.859,4.44,3670.0789999999997
minute the doctor falls in love with the,3670.74,3.78,3672.6299999999997

just wondering what to do next,3764.4,5.459,3767.1295

well maybe you don't take enough,4043.76,4.559,4046.0395000000003
but be careful,4046.52,4.7,4048.87
don't take too many,4048.319,2.901,4049.7695
look darling,4054.38,2.9,4055.83
try not to worry so much,4058.52,4.559,4060.7995
no matter what happens they can't do a,4061.039,4.681,4063.3795
thing without my consent,4063.079,5.46,4065.809
never in the world give that believe me,4065.72,4.56,4068.0
I know dear,4068.539,4.5,4070.789
so don't be too scared we'll never be,4070.28,5.279,4072.9195000000004
separated you and I are going to be,4073.039,3.54,4074.809
as long as we live,4076.579,3.72,4078.4390000000003
remember that darling,4078.319,4.641,4080.6394999999998
good night dear,4085.539,7.121,4089.0995000000003
I won't stay out too late goodbye,4088.4,4.26,4090.53
oh I wondered about how you lived,4198.5,4.34,4200.67
apologize for his neatness but I have no,4202.94,4.02,4204.95
woman around to keep it messed up all,4205.34,3.839,4207.2595
the time I'll hold it,4206.96,4.08,4209.0
could I get you something to drink no,4209.179,2.941,4210.6495
I hope I didn't alarm you with all that,4212.12,4.32,4214.28
urgency and mystery no I was just,4214.219,3.601,4216.0195
puzzled that you felt you had to have,4216.44,3.9,4218.389999999999
some excuse I'd have come anyway you you,4217.82,3.6,4219.62
but it wasn't an excuse I was quite,4223.82,3.54,4225.59
serious it's something I thought we,4226.219,3.301,4227.8695
should discuss right away privately but,4227.36,3.839,4229.2795
has it got to be tonight well I'm afraid,4229.52,3.42,4231.2300000000005
so dear it's quite important it's about,4231.199,3.121,4232.759499999999
you don't like Terry do you of course I,4234.32,4.859,4236.7495
like her but what,4236.9,3.48,4238.639999999999
but I love you,4240.38,3.54,4242.150000000001
do I love you why me not her that's,4243.92,5.7,4246.77
something I'm very curious about why did,4247.4,4.799,4249.7995
you choose me instead of her we're so,4249.62,4.619,4251.9295
much alike what was it you thought you,4252.199,4.681,4254.5395
saw on me that you didn't see in her,4254.239,5.041,4256.759499999999
how can I answer that,4256.88,4.62,4259.1900000000005
all I know is that you're the one I fell,4259.28,4.919,4261.7395
in love with what else do I have to know,4261.5,4.86,4263.93
am I better looking than,4264.199,4.081,4266.2395
to me you are of course,4266.36,2.94,4267.83
don't laugh,4268.28,2.399,4269.4794999999995
I want to know what you think the,4270.679,3.781,4272.5695000000005
difference is,4272.54,3.72,4274.4
for instance,4274.46,4.4,4276.66
now do you really believe you could tell,4282.44,4.32,4284.599999999999
that from one of Terry's or my lips from,4284.12,4.82,4286.53
I think so,4290.06,3.42,4291.77
have you ever kissed Terry,4291.44,5.04,4293.96
no well then how could you possibly know,4293.48,5.58,4296.2699999999995
how could you even say such a thing,4296.48,4.98,4298.969999999999
I'm not sure but,4299.06,5.34,4301.7300000000005
I think I'd know in my heart,4301.46,4.68,4303.8
would you really,4304.4,3.24,4306.0199999999995
I think so,4306.14,3.059,4307.6695
of course I don't believe it for a,4307.64,3.72,4309.5
second but I wanted to ask you anyway,4309.199,4.621,4311.509499999999
because well after all it's Terry they,4311.36,4.62,4313.67
usually go for she's the one that really,4313.82,5.1,4316.37
sends them but that's not true,4315.98,6.42,4319.19
of course it's true Terry's a smart one,4318.92,5.94,4321.89
I've told you that before,4322.4,3.839,4324.3195
no they don't go for a while,4326.239,3.781,4328.1295
that's the trouble with it that's what I,4328.28,3.419,4329.9895
wanted to talk to you about,4330.02,4.44,4332.240000000001
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean,4331.699,4.621,4334.009499999999
well it's not an easy thing to tell you,4334.46,4.199,4336.5595
but I I feel that I should,4336.32,4.08,4338.36
Terry's uh,4338.659,5.461,4341.389499999999
she's not well she's sick inside and she,4340.4,5.64,4343.219999999999
needs help from you and from me if,4344.12,3.599,4345.9195
Twisted inside,4352.34,4.379,4354.529500000001
how it got started I don't know some,4354.5,3.78,4356.39
incident when you were babies I imagine,4356.719,3.601,4358.5195
that you've both forgotten,4358.28,4.14,4360.349999999999
but there's a natural strong rivalry,4360.32,3.54,4362.09
between sisters,4362.42,3.96,4364.4
and ever since that incident whatever it,4363.86,4.68,4366.2
was it's grown more and more bitter in,4366.38,4.44,4368.6
her until now it's,4368.54,4.74,4370.91
it's abnormal and she needs care and,4370.82,4.379,4373.0095
attention right away,4373.28,4.7,4375.63
Terry and I have never been Rivals never,4375.199,5.161,4377.7795
at the slightest,4377.98,4.96,4380.459999999999
all women are Rivals fundamentally but,4380.36,3.9,4382.3099999999995
it never bothers them because they,4382.94,3.0,4384.44
automatically discount the successes of,4384.26,3.66,4386.09
others and Alibi their own failures on,4385.94,3.9,4387.889999999999
the grounds of circumstances,4387.92,3.72,4389.78
luck they say,4389.84,3.6,4391.64
but between sisters it's a little more,4391.64,4.14,4393.71
serious the circumstances are generally,4393.44,4.62,4395.75
about the same so they have fewer,4395.78,4.74,4398.15
excuses with which to comfort themselves,4398.06,4.74,4400.43
that's why sisters can hate each other,4400.52,5.52,4403.280000000001
with such terrifying intensity,4402.8,6.06,4405.83
that's for twins specially identical,4406.04,4.139,4408.1095
when you must have some idea yourself,4410.179,6.261,4413.3095
what agonies of jealousy are possible,4411.98,4.46,4414.209999999999
people men particularly find it easy,4426.86,4.2,4428.96
enough to like you you're natural and,4429.14,2.82,4430.55
by the grace of God you've managed to,4431.96,4.02,4433.97
escape that poison of rivalry and,4434.239,4.861,4436.6695
jealousy but not she in spite of the,4435.98,4.5,4438.23
truth of what you say that actually on,4439.1,2.579,4440.3895
the surface there's really so little to,4440.48,3.98,4442.469999999999
choose between you,4441.679,2.781,4443.0695000000005
that is of course a lie,4445.1,3.74,4446.97
all history of a case by her word as,4452.3,4.379,4454.489500000001
well as yours well that boy in Dayton,4454.34,3.18,4455.93
and the lawyer in Chicago and that,4457.52,3.96,4459.5
family that wanted to adopt you but not,4459.739,4.021,4461.7495
her it's the same story over and over,4461.48,4.62,4463.79
and over again whichever they met first,4463.76,4.08,4465.8
it was you they preferred in the end,4466.1,3.78,4467.990000000001
I've never listened to such utter,4467.84,4.08,4469.88
nonsense in all my life,4469.88,3.839,4471.7995
and I called you tonight because I want,4471.92,3.84,4473.84
you to talk to her,4473.719,4.201,4475.8195
I want you as the one nearest and,4475.76,4.08,4477.8
dearest to her to persuade her to go to,4477.92,3.42,4479.63
a doctor and put herself under his care,4479.84,3.42,4481.55
and I want you to get her to do this at,4481.34,4.5,4483.59
once and if I refuse to insult her with,4483.26,4.439,4485.4795
such incredible rocks but you mustn't I,4485.84,5.06,4488.37
can't tell how important is,4487.699,3.201,4489.299499999999
it is she refuses,4491.84,3.26,4493.47
if you refuse Terry I'm afraid I'll have,4496.159,7.771,4500.0445
to tell who killed Frank Peralta and why,4500.54,21.73,4511.405
you don't know,4536.239,5.581,4539.0295
I think I do,4538.82,4.8,4541.219999999999
not that it matters because there's,4541.82,3.18,4543.41
nothing you'll ever be able to do about,4543.62,2.34,4544.79
whatever you guess shall I remind you,4545.96,4.14,4548.03
if you wish,4550.1,4.2,4552.200000000001
Heraldo was killed because the same,4552.38,3.96,4554.36
thing happened to you again,4554.3,4.379,4556.489500000001
it was Ruthie really loved without even,4556.34,4.92,4558.8
knowing she existed what was you he,4558.679,4.861,4561.1095000000005
quoted took to dinner the movies the,4561.26,4.62,4563.570000000001
dance finally asked to marry him,4563.54,4.74,4565.91
he didn't know there were twins,4565.88,4.44,4568.1
all he knew was that every now and then,4568.28,3.72,4570.139999999999
the girl at the counter brought him a,4570.32,4.08,4572.36
warmth that he missed at other times,4572.0,4.62,4574.31
that's what puzzled him that's why he,4574.4,4.2,4576.5
asked me about a split personality,4576.62,3.66,4578.45
nor do I think you were aware of all,4578.6,2.88,4580.04
this until that night in his apartment,4580.28,2.76,4581.66
when he spoke of his curious difference,4581.48,3.36,4583.16
in you from time to time,4583.04,4.26,4585.17
then you knew what had happened again,4584.84,5.58,4587.63
was Ruthie was in love with not you,4587.3,5.04,4589.820000000001
so you made sure that if you couldn't,4590.42,6.56,4593.7
have his love neither should Ruth,4592.34,4.64,4594.66
who else have you told this to,4597.38,3.62,4599.1900000000005
say who else have you told this,4607.28,4.62,4609.59
ridiculous story too,4608.9,5.46,4611.629999999999
nobody else so far and there'll be no,4611.9,4.02,4613.91
need to tell it again if only you'll do,4614.36,3.839,4616.2795
what I suggest now go to your doctor and,4615.92,4.68,4618.26
be guided wholly by what he says,4618.199,4.441,4620.4195
I see no particular necessity for that,4620.6,4.139,4622.6695
it's just as I told you there's nothing,4622.64,3.72,4624.5
whatever you can do about it no matter,4624.739,4.98,4627.228999999999
how strongly you feel you don't think so,4626.36,5.94,4629.33
no I'm afraid you've just been wasting,4629.719,4.801,4632.1195
your time I haven't you forgotten Ruth,4632.3,5.399,4634.9995
not at all well you must have because I,4634.52,4.98,4637.01
can assure you she won't take this,4637.699,4.321,4639.8595
ridiculous story so lightly I don't,4639.5,4.739,4641.8695
suppose so she's been behaving so,4642.02,3.659,4643.8495
strangely lately that I wouldn't put,4644.239,2.881,4645.679499999999
anything past her,4645.679,3.121,4647.2395
but I doubt if anybody would take,4647.12,3.599,4648.9195
seriously the word of a girl who suffers,4648.8,4.32,4650.96
from hallucinations,4650.719,4.921,4653.1795
he told you,4653.12,5.28,4655.76
just a minute what do you mean by that,4655.64,4.079,4657.6795
there's Ruth now,4658.4,2.759,4659.7795
are you so sure you know which one,4661.159,4.02,4663.169
you've kissed of course I am look,4662.84,3.6,4664.64
are you certain,4666.44,3.02,4667.95
speaking have you still got that Terry,4675.02,4.44,4677.240000000001
there with you,4677.239,3.601,4679.0395
well could you bring her over by,4679.46,2.82,4680.87
yourself or do you want me to send the,4680.84,2.64,4682.16
just a minute,4683.48,2.54,4684.75
a guy from the hospital,4686.42,2.66,4687.75
duck but I'm afraid I got bad news for,4689.78,2.52,4691.04
I got nervous after I left you and I,4692.3,3.06,4693.83
decided to come over here and take a,4694.159,2.761,4695.5395
look for myself,4695.36,4.56,4697.639999999999
I hate to have to tell you this but when,4696.92,4.92,4699.38
I got in here,4699.92,4.52,4702.18
all right Stevenson I'll be right over,4718.06,4.8,4720.46
Ruth's dead,4726.32,5.16,4728.9
she's killed herself,4728.659,6.201,4731.759499999999
does that surprise you,4731.48,3.38,4733.169999999999
ly sorry doc but I,4749.739,4.061,4751.769499999999
I'm terribly sorry Miss Collins sit here,4753.8,7.08,4757.34
uh and may I go in well I suppose so if,4757.719,5.321,4760.3795
you want to The Examiner is in there you,4760.88,4.94,4763.35
go with him Franklin,4763.04,2.78,4764.43
tell me what happened,4768.5,3.719,4770.3595
she took some of this sleeping junk,4770.3,3.12,4771.860000000001
apparently,4772.219,3.121,4773.7795
it was empty on the wash Dam of the,4773.42,3.42,4775.13
she'd been taking it for the last two or,4776.84,3.24,4778.46
three months,4779.06,3.92,4781.02
Miss Collins,4780.08,2.9,4781.53
I hate to have to ask you questions at a,4784.699,3.901,4786.6494999999995
time like this but did you have any,4786.98,4.5,4789.23
reason that you know of,4788.6,5.22,4791.21
so I'm afraid she did what was it Miss,4791.48,4.8,4793.879999999999
Collins conscience,4793.82,4.08,4795.86
when I take your time Miss Collins I'm,4799.94,3.66,4801.7699999999995
not pressing you I know it's a tough,4802.159,2.52,4803.419
I'm all right it's just I've been under,4804.679,7.341,4808.3495
such a strain and I know this,4807.32,4.7,4809.67
but she's free now poor darling,4812.06,7.139,4815.6295
and I have a right to send peace too of,4815.719,5.46,4818.449
course you have make a clean best of it,4819.199,4.02,4821.209
now the whole thing you'd be surprised,4821.179,4.881,4823.6195
how much better you feel,4823.219,2.841,4824.6395
she killed him,4830.84,3.08,4832.38
she said she didn't but I know she did,4837.02,4.98,4839.51
I believed her at first I kept on,4839.78,4.379,4841.9695
believing her for a long time but now I,4842.0,4.92,4844.46
know she did it take this down,4844.159,5.58,4846.949
at night Miss Collins what happened when,4846.92,4.92,4849.38
I got home from Jefferson Park she was,4849.739,5.041,4852.259499999999
already in bed I thought asleep then,4851.84,4.2,4853.9400000000005
when it all came out she got me to,4854.78,2.82,4856.19
promise not to say anything because she,4856.04,3.42,4857.75
knew I knew she'd been out with him you,4857.6,3.67,4859.435
believed her then yes but,4859.46,4.879,4861.8995
you mean Ruth Harry,4869.78,5.1,4872.33
I'm Ruth it was a kind of deep,4872.48,3.6,4874.28
bitterness,4874.88,3.359,4876.5595
wait a minute,4876.08,4.44,4878.3
I thought you were Terry no I'm talking,4878.239,3.841,4880.1595
about Terry,4880.52,3.3,4882.17
but didn't you,4883.82,3.12,4885.38
didn't know what,4885.32,4.859,4887.7495
and nothing I'm just a little,4886.94,5.88,4889.879999999999
come on well then Scott found out about,4890.179,5.281,4892.8195000000005
it something in those tests and he told,4892.82,3.72,4894.679999999999
me tonight,4895.46,4.219,4897.5695
he told me she was,4896.54,3.139,4898.1095
she was sick inside with jealousy,4900.02,5.699,4902.869500000001
that's why she killed him Scott says,4903.62,4.14,4905.69
he didn't know that there were two of us,4905.719,5.101,4908.2695
all he knew was just a minute,4907.76,5.28,4910.400000000001
what are you trying to pull,4910.82,3.72,4912.679999999999
I was telling him what you told me dear,4913.04,3.96,4915.0199999999995
just about what you told me remember,4914.54,7.32,4918.2
this isn't Ruth this is Terry now Scott,4917.0,7.62,4920.81
once tonight this is ridiculous I know,4921.86,4.02,4923.87
this girl almost as well as I know,4924.62,3.18,4926.21
myself and it's Terry how do you know,4925.88,4.02,4927.89
how do I know I've been studying a daily,4927.8,4.14,4929.87
for almost two months why and the more,4929.9,3.24,4931.5199999999995
difficulty telling these girls apart,4931.94,3.299,4933.5895
than I am Telling You and Me Apart can,4933.14,4.62,4935.450000000001
you prove it prove it yeah all I know is,4935.239,3.96,4937.218999999999
that she says she's Ruth she certainly,4937.76,2.82,4939.17
sounds like Ruth and unless you have,4939.199,3.301,4940.849499999999
some way of proving different shall I go,4940.58,3.48,4942.32
on you bet I think we're beginning to,4942.5,2.76,4943.88
get somewhere with this thing go right,4944.06,2.22,4945.17
well the test only showed what I'd known,4946.28,3.78,4948.17
for a long time that she hated me hated,4947.96,3.719,4949.8195
me from the bottom of her heart because,4950.06,3.599,4951.8595000000005
men found it easy enough to like me but,4951.679,3.841,4953.5995
not her it was the same story over and,4953.659,3.54,4955.429
over and over again whichever they met,4955.52,3.06,4957.05
I'm sorry dear,4963.5,3.679,4965.3395
you're not sorry,4996.679,3.901,4998.6295
of course not the reason I didn't,4998.54,3.42,5000.25
explain to you what I was going to do I,5000.58,3.36,5002.26
didn't know myself till I got here,5001.96,3.66,5003.79
was only after a kind of a Dutch uncle,5003.94,3.36,5005.62
talk with Ruth the idea came to me and,5005.62,2.76,5007.0
then it was too late to explain anything,5007.3,2.46,5008.53
so I just had to take a chance that's,5008.38,4.14,5010.45
all well all I can say is you aged me 10,5009.76,4.68,5012.1
years and under the circumstances I,5012.52,4.139,5014.5895
forgive you want to know why I got,5014.44,5.94,5017.41
nervous why psychological reasons,5016.659,5.701,5019.509499999999
oh they're rubbed off on me I got to,5020.38,3.48,5022.12
thinking about what you told me then it,5022.36,3.0,5023.86
occurred to me that maybe Ruth was in,5023.86,3.06,5025.389999999999
more danger than you were,5025.36,3.66,5027.19
after all even a nut can figure out that,5026.92,3.54,5028.6900000000005
it's simpler to get rid of a rival than,5029.02,2.94,5030.490000000001
to go on knocking off her boyfriends all,5030.46,3.3,5032.11
the rest of her life,5031.96,3.66,5033.79
I take back what I said about the police,5033.76,5.78,5036.650000000001
Lieutenant thank you doc,5035.62,3.92,5037.58
fourth floor novelty Department 975 this,5056.02,5.179,5058.6095000000005

now reflections of each other everything,5077.56,4.32,5079.72
in reverse,5079.96,4.02,5081.97
and now will you answer one question for,5081.88,5.04,5084.400000000001
me what under the circumstances you're,5083.98,4.38,5086.169999999999
going to say it's impossible of course,5086.92,3.66,5088.75
why are you so much more beautiful than,5090.58,4.88,5093.0199999999995
your sister,5092.98,2.48,5094.219999999999

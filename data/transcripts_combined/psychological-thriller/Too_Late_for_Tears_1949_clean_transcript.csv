it's poison chain it's changing you it's,1228.159,3.841,1230.0795
changing both of us,1230.48,4.319,1232.6395
i wish it were that simple alan,1232.0,4.64,1234.32
but i haven't changed,1234.799,3.521,1236.5595
it's the way i am,1236.64,3.12,1238.2
you've got to let me keep that money,1238.32,3.68,1240.1599999999999
don't don't you no alan i won't let you,1239.76,4.159,1241.8395

chances like this are never offered,1243.919,4.161,1245.9995000000001
twice this is it i've been waiting for,1245.44,4.96,1247.92
it dreaming of it all my life even when,1248.08,3.68,1249.9199999999998
i was a kid,1250.4,3.6,1252.2
and it wasn't because we were poor not,1251.76,3.919,1253.7195
hungry poor at least,1254.0,2.96,1255.48
in a way it was far worse,1256.96,4.0,1258.96
they're a white-collar poor middle-class,1258.72,4.16,1260.8
poor the kind of people can't quite keep,1260.96,3.52,1262.72
up with the joneses and die little every,1262.88,3.2,1264.48
day because they cut,1264.48,3.52,1266.24
that's why i married blanchard i married,1266.08,3.68,1267.9199999999998
the first man who asked me because i i,1268.0,4.48,1270.24
thought he had money,1269.76,2.72,1271.12
it's it's true ellie,1272.96,3.599,1274.7595000000001
and you're right,1274.88,3.679,1276.7195000000002
i wasn't happy,1276.559,4.881,1278.9995
i was almost glad when it came,1278.559,4.641,1280.8795
things have changed now ellen,1283.2,4.0,1285.2
this is different,1285.76,3.36,1287.44
we'll be happier than we ever dreamed we,1287.2,4.0,1289.2
could be sure we will jane,1289.12,4.4,1291.32
but the money won't help they'll always,1291.2,4.64,1293.52
be joneses with a little more,1293.52,4.159,1295.5995
the only thing worth having is peace of,1295.84,5.839,1298.7595
mind and money can't buy that but,1297.679,6.88,1301.1190000000001
you agreed to wait for one week all,1301.679,3.681,1303.5195
we'll wait,1305.36,3.12,1306.9199999999998
but we're not going to keep it it's,1306.799,3.521,1308.5595
almost wrecked to sweetheart,1308.48,3.439,1310.1995
but i think it would take more than 100,1310.32,5.44,1313.04
grand to do that how about it,1311.919,3.841,1313.8395
i got an idea we'll go on a date,1316.08,4.959,1318.5594999999998

same things we did our first date,1323.6,4.48,1325.84
remember we'll have dinner at ramoli's,1325.44,4.0,1327.44
then we'll go down to the lake and get,1328.08,3.2,1329.6799999999998
one of those fancy little boats and go,1329.44,4.8,1331.8400000000001

you think of knocking yeah but then i,1365.12,3.84,1367.04
thought about the dull reading i found,1367.36,3.6,1369.1599999999999
in the newspapers,1368.96,4.0,1370.96
nothing at all about a bag full of dough,1370.96,4.4,1373.16
turning up at police headquarters,1372.96,5.52,1375.72
would you care for a drink mr fuller,1375.36,6.0,1378.36

a man named palmer but i can hardly,2800.24,3.68,2802.08
remember why,2802.24,4.0,2804.24
are you a friend of mr palmers,2803.92,3.28,2805.56
well i asked you first,2807.2,4.0,2809.2
we flew together in england in a weak,2809.28,3.44,2811.0
moment he asked me to drop by if i ever,2811.2,5.72,2814.06
got to hollywood oh,2812.72,4.2,2814.8199999999997
i live across the hall i'm alan's sister,2818.72,4.24,2820.8399999999997

anything we could wait till they're gone,2839.28,4.799,2841.6795
and i could just leave maybe they well,2841.2,6.0,2844.2
whoever is we're avoiding jane i gather,2844.079,5.921,2847.0395000000003
what's it all about,2847.2,2.8,2848.6
it's alan he's missing missing,2855.52,7.12,2859.08
since when last night about 10 o'clock,2858.64,4.0,2860.64
would you expect to find with your pesky,2868.319,4.401,2870.5195
i suppose i had to expect that question,2870.559,3.681,2872.3995
that's why i pulled you in here i didn't,2872.72,4.24,2874.8399999999997
want jane to know where you ran into me,2874.24,4.319,2876.3995
i gathered that,2876.96,3.119,2878.5195
i have 10 days coming to me and i look,2878.559,3.121,2880.1195000000002
forward to going into a happy coma on,2880.079,3.52,2881.8390000000004
one of your beaches,2881.68,3.84,2883.6
but if there's anything i can do i don't,2883.599,3.281,2885.2395
i just don't know,2886.88,3.199,2888.4795
where's gene she went down to the,2888.48,3.2,2890.08
missing persons bureau she hasn't come,2890.079,3.28,2891.719
why the pas key,2893.359,2.72,2894.719
why couldn't jane know what you were,2895.04,3.279,2896.6795
looking for,2896.079,5.76,2898.9590000000003
you didn't tell me your name,2898.319,3.52,2900.079
do you know my name,2904.48,3.68,2906.32
well alan mentioned it a few times but,2906.48,3.76,2908.36
i'm not quite sure,2908.16,3.6,2909.96
no it's katherine,2911.76,5.359,2914.4395000000004
i know what you're thinking,2915.2,3.44,2916.9199999999996
i can almost hear that mind of yours,2917.119,2.561,2918.3995
you're wondering why i'm so eager to,2919.68,2.56,2920.96
or maybe you're wondering why i'm so,2922.24,3.92,2924.2
willing to believe the worst of jane,2923.52,3.76,2925.4
i never met shane,2927.28,4.079,2929.3195
but i never liked her either,2928.96,3.599,2930.7595
you know her first husband killed,2931.359,3.361,2933.0395
himself jane had nothing to do with it,2932.559,3.681,2934.3995
the man had had money once and he just,2934.72,3.2,2936.3199999999997
couldn't stand being broke,2936.24,3.44,2937.9599999999996
well anyway getting back to alan you,2939.68,4.879,2942.1195
obviously think there's something wrong,2942.319,3.76,2944.199
and i wouldn't like to feel i walked out,2944.559,2.721,2945.9195
so if there's anything i can do or,2947.28,3.52,2949.0400000000004
anything that ought to be done,2948.559,5.76,2951.4390000000003
i'd appreciate you telling me about it,2950.8,3.519,2952.5595000000003
all right mr blake,2955.44,4.399,2957.6395
do you like talking now,2959.839,4.961,2962.3195
it's cold in here,2962.48,6.04,2965.5
i'll turn on the oven,2964.8,3.72,2966.6600000000003
maybe i shouldn't bother to light it,2971.599,2.581,2972.8895
i'll take it,2973.44,3.87,2975.375
so hubby pull the cross up is that it,2980.4,7.04,2983.92
the door is checked somewhere i gather,2984.88,5.36,2987.56
is it possible to get the bag without,2992.88,3.76,2994.76
the ticket i know exactly what it looks,2994.4,4.88,2996.84
like sure all you gotta do is describe,2996.64,4.719,2998.9995
the contents then the cops come and take,2999.28,4.48,3001.52
take it someplace in the apartment,3003.92,4.399,3006.1195000000002
i've got to get back,3008.319,4.721,3010.6794999999997
and i've got to have that gun,3011.2,4.399,3013.3995
sure i'll give you your gun,3013.04,4.64,3015.36
all you got to do is ask and dine a gift,3015.599,5.181,3018.1895
remember the ride we took last night,3023.119,3.761,3024.9995000000004
the money was buried up in the hill you,3026.88,3.76,3028.76
were taking me up there to give me my,3029.04,4.319,3031.1995
half remember,3030.64,4.479,3032.8795
you were taking me up there to kill me,3033.359,3.681,3035.1994999999997
you were gonna kill me,3037.04,3.54,3038.81
and now i give you back the gun,3039.119,4.561,3041.3995
i'll give it to you,3045.52,4.0,3047.52
but first i'm gonna get to know you,3048.079,3.441,3049.7995
i think probably someday you will kill,3051.52,4.0,3053.52
and i wouldn't want that to happen,3055.52,3.92,3057.48
unless we were,3057.52,4.64,3059.84
good friends,3059.44,2.72,3060.8
go ahead scream get the cops in here,3067.359,5.401,3070.0595

why don't you work work with alan just,3121.04,4.079,3123.0795
swallowed up someplace where have you,3123.2,4.24,3125.3199999999997
been walking thinking trying to figure,3125.119,4.401,3127.3195
this thing out jane i thought of,3127.44,4.56,3129.7200000000003
something this morning if alan just well,3129.52,4.48,3131.7599999999998
just went away don't you what do you,3132.0,4.4,3134.2
mean if he just went away,3134.0,4.079,3136.0395
what else could have happened i don't,3136.4,5.12,3138.96
know nothing seems to make any sense,3138.079,5.04,3140.599
does it ever,3141.52,3.2,3143.12
i thought of a way we might be able to,3143.119,4.321,3145.2795
tell alan's gun,3144.72,4.399,3146.9195
he loved that gun it was the only thing,3147.44,3.919,3149.3995
he saved from his army days if he'd,3149.119,3.681,3150.9595
known he was going away i think he'd,3151.359,3.841,3153.2795
have taken it with him don't you,3152.8,4.71,3155.155
we can easily find out,3155.2,18.48,3164.4399999999996
what's the matter with you,3173.68,4.56,3175.96
i think i know who it is jane it's a,3178.24,3.839,3180.1594999999998
friend of allen's i ran into him in the,3180.079,5.961,3183.0595000000003
hall he said he'd be back,3182.079,3.961,3184.0595000000003

oh my apologies mrs palmer i see what's,3213.68,3.919,3215.6394999999998
the missing person's detail is part of,3217.599,3.52,3219.3590000000004
the homicide division i've been assigned,3219.28,4.16,3221.36
to the case you reported oh,3221.119,3.921,3223.0795000000003
i'm afraid you frightened me for a,3223.44,3.84,3225.36
minute lieutenant i was afraid something,3225.04,5.68,3227.88
had happened i'm sorry,3227.28,3.44,3229.0
oh lieutenant breach my sister-in-law ms,3231.119,3.601,3232.9195
won't you sit down,3234.72,4.56,3237.0

i have some information for you you,3240.559,4.401,3242.7595
might prefer to discuss privately,3242.48,5.119,3245.0395
miss palmer's my husband's sister,3244.96,4.56,3247.2400000000002
is there anything you would like to add,3249.52,3.52,3251.28
something you didn't put into your,3251.52,2.72,3252.88
no not a thing,3254.24,2.879,3255.6794999999997
mrs palmer,3258.319,3.121,3259.8795
there's nothing illegal about being,3259.839,2.72,3261.199
we only work on a missing person's case,3262.559,4.321,3264.7195
if it's a juvenile or uh if there's some,3264.48,4.72,3266.84
evidence of foul play or,3266.88,4.479,3269.1195000000002
suicide or an accident,3269.2,3.44,3270.9199999999996
when we get evidence that it is,3271.359,3.601,3273.1594999999998
something else and it usually is,3272.64,5.04,3275.16
we don't touch it,3274.96,5.2,3277.56
so you see mrs palmer it isn't exactly,3277.68,4.399,3279.8795
playing ball with us to hold anything,3280.16,3.36,3281.8399999999997
hold what back lieutenant,3283.52,3.2,3285.12
the other woman mrs palmer,3287.119,3.521,3288.8795
what do you know about her,3292.96,4.08,3295.0
well it's the only thing we've uncovered,3294.88,4.08,3296.92
a bel air resident he's vice president,3298.96,4.72,3301.32
of a furniture plant out in vernon was,3301.44,3.76,3303.32
pulling out of his driveway last night,3303.68,4.8,3306.08
when this car your car driven by a woman,3305.2,5.359,3307.8795
almost crashed into him,3308.48,4.079,3310.5195
a man dressed like you described your,3310.559,4.0,3312.559
husband same size everything gets out of,3312.559,3.28,3314.199
apparently they'd had a quarrel,3315.839,5.52,3318.599
well that's about all our informants saw,3318.4,6.719,3321.7595
all he did was spot the license number,3321.359,6.24,3324.479
it might have been foul play i doubt it,3325.119,6.401,3328.3195
i i suspect they patched it up,3327.599,3.921,3329.5595000000003
do you know anything about this woman,3331.599,3.76,3333.4790000000003
mrs palmer,3333.04,4.319,3335.1995
not very much i'm afraid,3335.359,3.121,3336.9195
i've only seen her once or twice she,3338.48,5.839,3341.3995
she's a little taller than i am,3341.68,4.96,3344.16
hair a little darker,3344.319,4.24,3346.439
brown eyes i think,3346.64,4.159,3348.7194999999997
i don't know her name or where she lives,3350.88,4.88,3353.32
jane you never told me why because i,3353.04,6.279,3356.1795
didn't think it meant,3355.76,3.559,3357.5395000000003
it's for you,3367.599,4.801,3369.9995000000004
oh i told the bureau i'd be here,3368.88,3.52,3370.6400000000003
okay thanks come on,3383.04,3.279,3384.6795
i'm afraid that wraps it up,3386.4,3.36,3388.08
if you really want some action on your,3388.4,3.12,3389.96
husband mrs palmer i'd suggest you bring,3389.76,3.359,3391.4395000000004
in some private help,3391.52,3.599,3393.3195
your car was located 12 miles south of,3393.119,3.761,3394.9995000000004
san diego just this side of the mexican,3395.119,3.041,3396.6395
your husband wasn't in some kind of,3398.16,3.679,3399.9995
trouble was he mrs palmer no,3399.599,4.161,3401.6795

much like you what do you mean by that,3429.52,4.559,3431.7995
are you trying to imply,3431.839,5.361,3434.5195

advocate of the holman hearth hi,3496.319,4.321,3498.4795

the hall making like a tenor trying to,3630.72,2.639,3632.0395

i watched him for a while as i got off,3633.359,2.96,3634.839
the elevator,3634.96,2.879,3636.3995

boats and when they come back she get,4040.24,4.64,4042.56
you know i just thought of something,4043.119,3.041,4044.6395
he helped her out of the boat real,4046.16,3.199,4047.7594999999997
polite light and he goes upstairs and,4047.359,4.801,4049.7595
she goes over there and pays,4049.359,5.281,4051.9995
some guy well they're married you know,4052.16,5.28,4054.7999999999997
oh that explains everything,4054.64,4.32,4056.7999999999997
you know uh the man usually pays for,4058.96,3.68,4060.8
things even when he's married to the,4061.2,2.48,4062.4399999999996
did alan happen to be an exception to,4064.48,3.52,4066.2400000000002
that rule he is rather absent mileage,4065.92,4.0,4067.92
you must have noticed that,4068.0,2.72,4069.36
sure that's right,4070.72,8.12,4074.7799999999997
well i think we better say good night,4079.68,2.32,4080.8399999999997
i think it's better if jane doesn't see,4082.0,2.96,4083.48
us together too much,4083.44,4.0,4085.44
well i sort of made saying good night,4087.68,4.24,4089.7999999999997
sound like quite a project didn't i,4089.76,5.12,4092.32
yes i thought so,4091.92,2.96,4093.4
oh ten days in town,4096.239,4.401,4098.4394999999995
i don't think you'd go for that kind of,4100.64,3.92,4102.6
idea would you,4102.0,4.96,4104.48
but i see what you mean,4106.96,7.04,4110.4800000000005
good night miss palmer honey,4114.0,3.199,4115.5995
did you really fly with alan,4117.679,5.04,4120.1990000000005
hey what kind of a question is that an,4120.48,3.52,4122.24
honest one,4122.719,4.48,4124.959
i hope you'll give me an honest answer,4124.0,4.88,4126.44
you seem so terribly concerned about,4127.199,3.52,4128.959
what happened to alan,4128.88,3.359,4130.5595
that you never talk about him as though,4130.719,4.241,4132.8395
you really knew him,4132.239,2.721,4133.599499999999
maybe there's a reason kate,4137.359,3.84,4139.279
i'm afraid if i did i'd be talking about,4141.199,3.761,4143.0795
him in the past tense,4142.799,3.841,4144.7195
what makes you say that,4144.96,4.399,4147.1595
oh i don't know,4146.64,6.48,4149.88
just a peculiar feeling i've had,4149.359,5.761,4152.239500000001
about jane,4153.12,3.679,4154.9595
now look let's get squared away on her,4155.12,3.039,4156.6395
and then i'll talk about myself to decry,4158.159,3.361,4159.8395

if you've got something to tell me let's,5211.6,3.2,5213.200000000001
i think you'll find her husband at the,5214.8,2.82,5216.21
bottom of the lake at west lake park,5216.159,2.801,5217.559499999999
you don't say,5218.96,3.44,5220.68

they also left it together oh now look,5225.679,4.401,5227.8795
when they left the boat palmer was in a,5228.56,3.52,5230.320000000001
great big hurry he left the pain to his,5230.08,4.24,5232.2
wife and dashed up the steps and now i,5232.08,3.92,5234.04

palmer never got off that boat this guy,5236.0,3.52,5237.76
then he drove palmer's car to san diego,5239.52,4.159,5241.5995
i could point out a dozen things wrong,5242.08,3.44,5243.8

department to close that lake and drag,5264.4,2.319,5265.559499999999

commission and the bureau of budget and,5268.32,3.919,5270.2795
efficiency and if the lake management,5270.32,3.6,5272.12
raised enough of a hassle we might even,5272.239,3.681,5274.0795
have to go to the city council,5273.92,4.88,5276.36

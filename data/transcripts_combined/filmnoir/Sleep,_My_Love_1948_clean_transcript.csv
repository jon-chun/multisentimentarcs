Mrs cotland there is no question here a,1694.1,5.34,1696.77

this than about what went on before this,1701.12,4.58,1703.4099999999999

Reinhardt good reputation,1714.98,5.52,1717.74
tell me Bobby has um has Alison ever,1717.44,5.339,1720.1095
needed or I've ever been to a,1720.5,4.14,1722.57
psychiatrist before Oh gracious no all,1722.779,3.301,1724.4295
the Penningtons are desperately healthy,1724.64,4.639,1726.9595000000002
real rocks of Gibraltar,1726.08,3.199,1727.6795
after such a brief interview I can't,1733.24,4.12,1735.3
tell her precisely what's your wife is,1735.679,2.701,1737.0295
suffering from,1737.36,3.54,1739.1299999999999
physically she,1738.38,4.74,1740.75
she seems to be in perfect health yes,1740.9,4.2,1743.0
but mentally Mrs cotton does had a,1743.12,4.86,1745.55
profound shock and there is a certain,1745.1,5.28,1747.74
amount of tension also a fairly,1747.98,4.679,1750.3195
well-defined anxiety,1750.38,4.56,1752.66
of course we must realize that her,1754.94,4.2,1757.04
recent experiences whether imagined or,1756.679,3.36,1758.3590000000002
have been of a peculiarly varied nature,1760.039,4.52,1762.299
oh uh when you go back to see her just,1765.26,5.7,1768.11
let her talk reassure,1768.38,4.32,1770.5400000000002

make up the couch in Mrs Cotton's room,3465.0,2.46,3466.23
I'll stay there the rest of the night,3466.44,3.84,3468.36

I'm butting in here and yet,3470.28,4.799,3472.6795
what good Heavens don't you realize if,3473.339,5.361,3476.0195
you hadn't come along Allison you might,3475.079,3.621,3476.8895
well it's fortunate that you,3478.74,5.819,3481.6495
incidentally what did bring you back,3482.28,4.98,3484.77
I uh I came back here tonight because,3484.559,5.04,3487.079
look uh why don't you sit oh yes oh can,3487.26,3.839,3489.1795
I have one of your cigarettes apparently,3489.599,4.621,3491.9095

thank you I um,3494.22,4.7,3496.5699999999997
I came back here tonight well,3497.099,3.96,3499.079
deliberately in fact because,3498.92,4.139,3500.9895
these Chinese kids were sitting my car,3501.059,4.141,3503.1295
said they saw somebody on the street out,3503.059,3.821,3504.9695
there what did he look like they didn't,3505.2,3.119,3506.7594999999997
see him very clearly naturally I thought,3506.88,2.52,3508.1400000000003
it might be the fella that Al is,3508.319,2.461,3509.5495
impossible,3509.4,3.36,3511.08
I suppose so,3510.78,3.18,3512.3700000000003
and yet I can't believe it's all,3512.76,3.599,3514.5595000000003
hallucination on Allison's farm and this,3513.96,4.139,3516.0295
man that the kids saw must have been,3516.359,3.96,3518.339
selling from The Parkers,3518.099,4.921,3520.5595000000003
the Parker yes the people across the,3520.319,4.441,3522.5395
street they're always given parties must,3523.02,2.76,3524.4
have been one of their guests on his way,3524.76,3.299,3526.4095
home walking I'll probably a guest who,3525.78,4.799,3528.1795
lives nearby that's right some neighbor,3528.059,4.02,3530.0690000000004
no I could have been all through this,3530.579,3.0,3532.079
with a police and a doctor,3532.079,3.72,3533.9390000000003
look the other afternoon in an imaginary,3533.579,3.661,3535.4095
psychiatrist giving her a fantastic,3535.799,3.3,3537.449
examination tonight after you brought,3537.24,2.819,3538.6495
her home he was in the living room,3539.099,2.881,3540.5395000000003
trying to frighten her just now we found,3540.059,3.721,3541.9195
her on the balcony unconscious you saw,3541.98,3.78,3543.87
her yourself yeah she'd walk him to,3543.78,3.72,3545.6400000000003
sleep that's how she got to Boston in a,3545.76,4.28,3547.9
complete trance,3547.5,2.54,3548.77
I don't know what to do with it Allison,3550.26,4.26,3552.3900000000003
is a very sick woman,3552.839,3.901,3554.7895
and I wanted to help,3554.52,3.72,3556.38
better mind my own business I guess,3556.74,3.3,3558.39
you've done more than a help,3558.24,4.079,3560.2794999999996
I'll never forget that,3560.04,4.86,3562.47
anyway Allison won't be left alone again,3562.319,4.5,3564.569
I'll see you there,3564.9,5.3,3567.55

up early did you sleep well no not too,3606.359,4.321,3608.5195
I had an awful dream,3610.68,5.58,3613.47
I dreamed I was,3613.799,4.32,3615.959
dick why was the couch made up in my,3616.26,3.42,3617.9700000000003
I was concerned about you last night,3621.839,4.141,3623.9094999999998
darling I slept there,3623.4,5.459,3626.1295
you must have been so uncomfortable no,3625.98,5.339,3628.6495
it wasn't bad at all and it kept me from,3628.859,4.021,3630.8695
worrying about you,3631.319,5.061,3633.8495
the dream very bad Alison,3632.88,3.5,3634.63
I was running away,3637.559,4.74,3639.929
climbing over something High,3639.72,5.339,3642.3894999999998
I can't remember much Evan maybe that's,3642.299,4.02,3644.309
just as well,3645.059,3.54,3646.829
Nick it was that man the one with the,3646.319,5.161,3648.8995
glasses he was after me,3648.599,5.46,3651.329
good morning good morning Helen I'll,3654.059,3.361,3655.7395
I have such a splitting headache,3662.819,4.561,3665.0995
did you put anything on my chocolate,3666.059,2.881,3667.4995000000004
last night,3667.38,3.179,3668.9695
why didn't you tell me Dr Reinhardt told,3673.68,3.78,3675.5699999999997
me to give you a sedative whenever you,3676.26,3.599,3678.0595000000003
have one of those attacks attacks I hate,3677.46,3.72,3679.32
her to do it Allison,3679.859,3.301,3681.5095
what are you talking about,3681.18,3.78,3683.0699999999997
I didn't have an attack,3683.16,3.959,3685.1394999999998
I do not have a tax,3684.96,4.74,3687.33
I saw that man standing in the living,3687.119,4.021,3689.1295
oh I've had enough of all this I'm going,3691.14,4.5,3693.39
to the police about it Allison,3692.819,4.081,3694.8595
the police,3695.64,2.939,3697.1095
to have them find him and arrest him,3696.9,3.6,3698.7000000000003
find out why he's persecuting me and,3698.579,4.581,3700.8695000000002
make him stop,3700.5,2.66,3701.83
while doing a thing like that make us,3704.52,3.92,3706.48
look a little,3706.2,2.24,3707.3199999999997
which seems to be the least desirable,3708.54,4.559,3710.8195
looking ridiculous to the police so am I,3710.94,4.32,3713.1
being driven out of my mind there is n't,3713.099,3.781,3714.9895
for you there is he's going to say there,3715.26,3.9,3717.21
is no need for you to snap at me,3716.88,4.76,3719.26
sometimes I feel that nothing I do,3722.4,3.3,3724.05
really affects you deeply,3724.02,4.2,3726.12
why Alice I understood the police find,3725.7,5.54,3728.47
this man and arrest him,3728.22,3.02,3729.73
since you feel the way you do I think we,3733.26,4.76,3735.6400000000003
should go to the police,3735.42,2.6,3736.7200000000003
could I just swear out a warrant or,3744.18,3.96,3746.16
something Mrs Cortland we want to help,3746.22,3.78,3748.1099999999997
you as much as possible,3748.14,3.719,3749.9995
but surely you realize we can't go out,3750.0,3.359,3751.6795
and pick up every man in certain place,3751.859,2.94,3753.3289999999997
who happens to be wearing horn Rim,3753.359,3.901,3755.3095
glasses the mayor wouldn't like it he,3754.799,4.381,3756.9895
wouldn't like it at all I'm not asking,3757.26,3.72,3759.1200000000003
you to pick up a lot of men just this,3759.18,4.5,3761.43
one I want him arrested it seems simple,3760.98,4.2,3763.08
enough to me,3763.68,4.139,3765.7495
isn't there some kind of Warrant well,3765.18,4.679,3767.5195
you could swear out a John Doe warrant I,3767.819,3.661,3769.6495
guess but if I were you I'd think this,3769.859,4.081,3771.8995
overall doesn't need to I believe her if,3771.48,4.44,3773.7
you don't miss man ought to be arrested,3773.94,4.44,3776.16
I'll swear out the warrant myself thank,3775.92,4.74,3778.29

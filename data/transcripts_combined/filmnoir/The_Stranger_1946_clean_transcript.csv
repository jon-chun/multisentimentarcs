ridiculous oh there may be some fanatics,1787.6,4.679,1789.9395
but no German in his right mind can,1790.48,4.799,1792.8795

unpopular well we shall consider it the,1808.799,5.641,1811.6195
objective opinion of an objective,1811.88,4.6,1814.18
historian a psychiatrist could explain,1816.48,5.4,1819.18
it better the German sees himself as the,1819.0,5.32,1821.66
innocent victim of world envy and hatred,1821.88,5.639,1824.6995000000002
conspired against set upon by inferior,1824.32,5.959,1827.2994999999999
peoples inferior Nations he cannot admit,1827.519,5.121,1830.0795
to error much less to wrongdoing not the,1830.279,4.841,1832.6995
German we chose to ignore Ethiopia and,1832.64,4.68,1834.98
Spain but we learned from our casualty,1835.12,4.2,1837.2199999999998
list the price of looking the other way,1837.32,3.44,1839.04
men of Truth everywhere have come to,1839.32,5.199,1841.9195
know For Whom the Bell told but not the,1840.76,6.48,1844.0
German he still follows his Warrior,1844.519,5.52,1847.279
guards marching to vagian strains his,1847.24,5.2,1849.84
eyes still fixed upon the fiery sword of,1850.039,4.601,1852.3395
seek freed and in those Subterranean,1852.44,4.04,1854.46
meeting places that you don't believe in,1854.64,3.8,1856.5400000000002
the Germans dream comes alive and he,1856.48,4.36,1858.66
takes his place in shining armor beneath,1858.44,6.119,1861.4995000000001
the banners of the tonic Knights mankind,1860.84,5.839,1863.7595
is waiting for the Messiah but for the,1864.559,6.0,1867.559
German the Messiah is not the Prince of,1866.679,8.321,1870.8395
Peace he's he another,1870.559,7.84,1874.479

Germany I don't know Mr Wilson I can't,1886.159,5.841,1889.0795
believe that people can be reformed,1889.48,3.52,1891.24
except from,1892.0,3.679,1893.8395
within the basic principles of equality,1893.0,4.24,1895.12
and freedom never have never will take,1895.679,3.24,1897.299
root in Germany the will to Freedom has,1897.24,4.08,1899.28
been voiced in every other tongue all,1898.919,4.801,1901.3195
men are created equal Liber gity,1901.32,7.04,1904.84
fraternity but in German there's Marx,1903.72,6.24,1906.84

lose but your chains but Marx wasn't a,1909.96,5.12,1912.52
German Marx was a Jew but my dear,1912.399,4.601,1914.6995

it's for their,3612.96,2.52,3614.2200000000003
benefit uh gas chamber Mrs,3616.68,6.0,3619.68
Ranken the candidates were first given,3620.16,4.72,3622.52
hot shower so that their paws would be,3622.68,4.56,3624.96
open and the gas would act that much,3624.88,4.6,3627.1800000000003
quickly and this is lime pit in which,3629.48,5.24,3632.1
hundreds of men women and children were,3633.16,3.959,3635.1394999999998
alive why do you want me to look at,3638.319,6.161,3641.3995
these Horrors all this you're,3640.28,4.2,3642.38
seeing it's all the product of one,3645.559,6.48,3648.799
mind the mind of a man,3648.96,6.2,3652.06
named France Kindler,3652.039,5.641,3654.8595
France Kindler yes he was the most,3655.16,3.8,3657.06
brilliant of the younger minds of the,3657.68,2.28,3658.8199999999997
party it was Kindler who conceived the,3659.96,4.92,3662.42
theory of genocide Mass the population,3662.24,4.76,3664.62
of conquered countries so that,3664.88,3.84,3666.8
regardless of who won the war Germany,3667.0,3.119,3668.5595
would emerge the strongest nation in,3668.72,4.359,3670.8995
Western Europe biologically speaking,3670.119,5.361,3672.7995
unlike Gables himler and the rest of,3673.079,5.52,3675.8390000000004
them Kindler had a passion for anonymity,3675.48,5.639,3678.2995
the newspapers carried no picture of him,3678.599,5.041,3681.1195000000002
oh no and just before he disappeared he,3681.119,4.24,3683.239
destroyed every evidence that might link,3683.64,3.36,3685.3199999999997
him with his past down to the last,3685.359,3.72,3687.219
fingerprint there's no clue to the,3687.0,4.799,3689.3995
identity of France Kindler except one,3689.079,3.681,3690.9195
thing he has a hobby that almost amounts,3692.76,3.72,3694.6200000000003
clocks so have lots of people you,3699.72,6.639,3703.0395
yourself well I I'm not quite finished,3703.28,4.72,3705.6400000000003
Ranken in prison in Czechoslovakia a war,3708.0,5.92,3710.96
criminal was awaiting execution this was,3711.48,4.76,3713.86
Conrad miniki one time executive officer,3713.92,3.679,3715.7595
for France,3716.24,3.72,3718.1
Kindler he was an obscenity on the face,3717.599,5.881,3720.5395000000003
of the earth a stench of burning flesh,3719.96,5.92,3722.92
was in his clothes but we gave him his,3723.48,4.2,3725.58
freedom on the chance that he might lead,3725.88,3.0,3727.38
Kindler he led me here Mrs,3728.88,5.239,3731.4995
Ranken and here I lost,3731.599,4.52,3733.8590000000004
yesterday your dog Grett found him for,3736.119,5.761,3738.9995000000004
me but unfortunately miniki was dead and,3738.52,7.839,3742.4395
buried now in all the world,3741.88,4.479,3744.1195000000002
there is only one person who can,3746.68,4.04,3748.7
identify France,3748.4,5.399,3751.0995000000003
Kindler that person is the one who,3750.72,6.559,3753.9995
knows knows definitely who Miki came to,3753.799,6.0,3756.799
see no he's not an ny my Charles is not,3764.16,5.639,3766.9795

with this man Kindler except a wild,3794.68,4.639,3796.9995
suspicion it's a ridiculous suspicion,3796.359,4.801,3798.7595
you're trying to use me to implicate him,3799.319,4.161,3801.3995
and you can't you can't involve me in a,3801.16,5.52,3803.92
lie and that's that's all it is is a lie,3803.48,5.96,3806.46

innocently married a criminal well then,3877.16,4.919,3879.6195

him Charles was not with you that,3900.799,4.601,3903.0995
afternoon sister I remember you're,3903.2,4.28,3905.3399999999997
saying so when you came home you're,3905.4,4.879,3907.8395
against him too Adam yes you are you've,3907.48,4.28,3909.62
never liked him that's why you don't,3910.279,3.881,3912.2195
believe me now leave us alone,3911.76,5.4,3914.46
Adam he's not an AE he's not one of,3914.16,5.04,3916.68
those people he's not leave us,3917.16,5.919,3920.1195
she has the facts,3925.88,5.0,3928.38
now but she won't accept,3927.72,7.44,3931.4399999999996
them they're too horrible for her to,3930.88,4.28,3933.02
acknowledge not so much that Rankin,3935.2,4.32,3937.3599999999997
could be Kindler but that she could ever,3937.24,5.559,3940.0195
have given her love to such a,3939.52,3.279,3941.1595
creature but we have one Ally her,3943.16,6.04,3946.18
subconscious it knows what the truth is,3947.119,4.0,3949.119
and is struggling to be,3949.2,4.359,3951.3795
heard the will to truth within your,3951.119,5.641,3953.9395
daughter is much too strong to be,3953.559,5.961,3956.5395000000003
denied look here Wilson if he's not,3956.76,4.12,3958.82
Charles Rankin we should be able to,3959.52,3.44,3961.24
expose him without too much difficulty,3960.88,3.399,3962.5795000000003
I'm not interested in proving that he,3962.96,3.079,3964.4995
isn't Charles Ranken I'm only interested,3964.279,3.361,3965.9595
in proving that he's France Kindler how,3966.039,4.481,3968.2795
do you propose to do,3967.64,2.88,3969.08
that through your,3973.0,5.76,3975.88
daughter unless I mistaken she's headed,3976.359,4.68,3978.699
for a breakdown that's the usual result,3978.76,4.16,3980.84
of a person being inwardly divided,3981.039,3.481,3982.7795
Ranken will recognize and that's what,3982.92,3.399,3984.6195000000002
I'm banking on what do you mean well he,3984.52,3.039,3986.0395
can't afford to trust a person,3986.319,2.841,3987.7395
approaching hysteria he won't he'll have,3987.559,4.0,3989.559
to act he may try to escape before she,3989.16,3.72,3991.02
collapses which would only be an,3991.559,2.441,3992.7795
admission of,3992.88,2.679,3994.2195
or go on you may kill,3995.559,6.76,3998.9390000000003
her you're shocked at my,4000.44,3.72,4002.3
cold-bloodedness well that's quite,4002.319,4.401,4004.5195
natural you're a father it's because you,4004.16,4.48,4006.3999999999996
are a Father Judge longstry that I,4006.72,3.879,4008.6594999999998
talking to you like,4008.64,4.679,4010.9795
this naturally we'll try to prevent,4010.599,5.401,4013.2995
murder being de,4013.319,2.681,4014.6594999999998
done however the proof that murder is a,4016.559,4.321,4018.7195
name would be the strongest evidence,4019.279,3.551,4021.0545
that your daughter could,4020.88,14.88,4028.32
listen striking for 100 years after more,4047.079,4.601,4049.3795

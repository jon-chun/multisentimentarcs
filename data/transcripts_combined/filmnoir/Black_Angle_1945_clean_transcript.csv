for you to come down there I guess I was,1647.96,4.88,1650.4
a little rough on you I'm afraid I asked,1650.919,5.681,1653.7595000000001
for it you see I needed help I still do,1652.84,6.839,1656.2595

like where'd you get this music store in,1679.72,5.0,1682.22
Hollywood Boulevard you see when I found,1682.88,3.399,1684.5795
out she was playing it that night I've,1684.72,3.04,1686.24
been thinking about that,1686.279,4.161,1688.3595
too ever since you told,1687.76,6.68,1691.1
me do you play no no Kirk played and I'd,1690.44,8.2,1694.54
sing at least we did when we were first,1694.44,4.2,1696.54
married he didn't do,1700.44,5.959,1703.4195
it knocking yourself out aren't you,1702.84,7.079,1706.3795
trying to help a guy who let you down,1706.399,5.961,1709.3794999999998
trouble he doesn't look like a murderer,1715.76,5.2,1718.36
does he they never,1717.96,3.0,1719.46
do this isn't the man I saw are you sure,1722.399,6.921,1725.8594999999998
yes there was someone else there that,1727.159,3.76,1729.0390000000002
night of course there was Kirk heard,1729.32,3.16,1730.8999999999999
someone but I took it for granted that,1730.919,4.041,1732.9395000000002
the man going in was your husband it,1732.48,4.6,1734.78
must have been the murderer the man who,1734.96,5.079,1737.4995000000001
stole the brooch,1737.08,2.959,1738.5594999999998
yes I brought him to see you dear,1753.24,4.039,1755.2595000000001
because he's interested in that brooch I,1755.48,4.12,1757.54
thought you ought to describe it to him,1757.279,4.801,1759.6795
well it was an odd sort of piece,1759.6,5.48,1762.34
heart-shaped made of rubies you've seen,1762.08,6.959,1765.5594999999998

it was the only thing she left behind,1769.039,3.88,1770.979
when she walked out but it was there,1770.64,3.879,1772.5795
that night Kirk saw it it was our,1772.919,3.401,1774.6195
anniversary I just sent it to her by,1774.519,4.4,1776.719
messenger hoping she'd,1776.32,4.959,1778.7994999999999
remember she'd have been alive today if,1778.919,5.24,1781.539

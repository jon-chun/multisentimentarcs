meeting you're going to this morning,653.92,3.28,655.56
is uh Captain MSY going to be down,663.0,7.239,666.6195
mhm Brandy is the very best drink in the,671.88,5.72,674.74
world if you're drink enough your toes,674.839,3.031,676.3545
curled Calypso statistics show that if,679.72,5.08,682.26
the level of alcohol in the blood,682.839,5.12,685.399
exceeds 1 half of 1% the blood pressure,684.8,6.039,687.8195
is affected as cerebral condition occurs,687.959,3.961,689.9395
then you're,691.92,3.28,693.56
cockeyed and maybe that's the way it,697.04,4.16,699.12
be you don't Lang dis Place doc what for,711.56,6.6,714.8599999999999
you stay here you haven't got much,715.399,7.24,719.019
choice calyon so neither have,718.16,4.479,720.3995
I but it's not as easy as all that Mr,725.04,4.88,727.48
mallum this,728.16,4.32,730.3199999999999
prison this prison has almost twice as,729.92,5.039,732.4395
many men as it was built to accommodate,732.48,3.84,734.4
there's not enough work to keep the,734.959,3.44,736.679
inmates occupied why,736.32,5.72,739.1800000000001
not the world we live in yes we can give,738.399,6.0,741.399
them real work teach them trades produce,742.04,4.68,744.38
things but the civilian manufacturer,744.399,3.8,746.299
says we're competing with him Trade,746.72,3.16,748.3000000000001
union say we're put their people out of,748.199,5.521,750.9594999999999
work nobody wants to help not us,749.88,6.36,753.06
manufacturers unions you might as well,753.72,4.72,756.08
blame the weather what you're really,756.24,5.88,759.1800000000001
saying is you can't handle the,758.44,3.68,760.2800000000001
situation excuse me sir I don't think,763.36,4.719,765.7195
you quite understood what the warden,766.519,3.68,768.359
meant it's not only a matter of,768.079,4.641,770.3995
controlling the man he wants to help,770.199,4.961,772.6795
them Mony what this prison needs is,772.72,5.119,775.2795
absolute discipline not,775.16,5.08,777.6999999999999
charity your loyalty to the warden,777.839,3.761,779.7195
doesn't change the fact that he may be,780.24,4.52,782.5
getting too old for his job age Mr mum,781.6,6.239,784.7195
is a matter of arteries not years it's a,784.76,4.84,787.18
Pity walers you're a better philosopher,787.839,3.521,789.5995
than you are a doctor but I'm getting,789.6,4.28,791.74
tired of you in both roles I was sent,791.36,4.36,793.54
here today for one reason to tell you,793.88,3.6,795.68
that if there's any more trouble if this,795.72,3.239,797.3395
prison isn't brought under the strictest,797.48,3.919,799.4395000000001
control Mr M there will be an immediate,798.959,5.68,801.799
change in practically all Personnel we,801.399,5.201,803.9995
don't want to be bothered,804.639,6.121,807.6995000000001
anymore is that clear Warden,806.6,4.16,808.6800000000001
yes clear to you Doctor oh,812.24,6.599,815.5395
absolutely you can't be,815.6,7.16,819.1800000000001
bothered well that simplifies,818.839,6.56,822.119
everything the great,822.76,6.36,825.9399999999999
public and its servants you put up,825.399,6.44,828.619
prisons thick walls and then your job is,829.12,5.44,831.84
finished but is it,834.56,6.12,837.6199999999999
over you and your Pat medicine remedies,836.68,8.36,840.8599999999999
change the warden new Personnel absolute,840.68,6.399,843.8794999999999
Discipline Do you know what this prison,845.04,5.32,847.6999999999999
is Mr mcallum one big human bomb and you,847.079,5.641,849.8995
say kick it and it'll be quiet smash it,850.36,3.399,852.0595
and it won't,852.72,2.64,854.0400000000001
myy what do you think of the doctor's,855.36,4.279,857.4995
Viewpoint I think say that on occasion,857.519,7.201,861.1195
the doctor becomes unduly alarmed,859.639,5.081,862.1795
Wen I I don't,864.759,6.88,868.1990000000001
know I do like so many dreamers and,867.68,6.04,870.6999999999999
drunkards the doctor's emotional words,871.639,5.361,874.3195000000001
are empty what's your solution all I,873.72,5.0,876.22
know is that when people are sick you,877.0,4.04,879.02
don't cure them by making them sicker by,878.72,4.08,880.76
your methods we send the man back to,881.04,3.4,882.74
society a worse criminal than he was,882.8,3.399,884.4994999999999
when they sent him to us platitudes,884.44,4.6,886.74
doctor I'm waiting for your solution for,886.199,5.2,888.799
men like you Mr mallum there will never,889.04,4.28,891.18
be any solution wait a minut not why you,891.399,4.721,893.7595
want to destroy instead of build what we,893.32,4.879,895.7595
need here is a little more patience and,896.12,4.0,898.12
much more understanding we've been,898.199,5.121,900.7595

Eddie's place in Miami I had just sold a,1691.799,5.641,1694.6195
trusting gentleman a few shares in a,1695.36,4.36,1697.54

afternoon but we were already very good,1702.32,4.8,1704.72
friends the dice were hot and she kept,1705.0,4.559,1707.2795
them that way I was heading for a,1707.12,4.96,1709.6
fortune suddenly just when everything,1709.559,5.281,1712.1995
was sunshine and Roses I heard the old,1712.08,5.36,1714.76
familiar noises leave it to the police,1714.84,4.839,1717.2595
to break up a wonderful evening it,1717.44,3.64,1719.26
looked as though everybody was caught,1719.679,4.041,1721.6995000000002
with their chips down the raid didn't,1721.08,4.76,1723.46
worry me but the gun I was carrying was,1723.72,4.92,1726.18
a problem so flossy had me slip the gun,1725.84,5.0,1728.34
into her purse she was not only,1728.64,5.24,1731.26
beautiful she knew the score as well,1730.84,4.88,1733.28
furthermore she knew precisely how to,1733.88,3.96,1735.8600000000001
guide me through a back exit obviously,1735.72,4.4,1737.92
the girl was no tourist my car was,1737.84,4.0,1739.84

with such a Dream doll beside me I,1748.08,4.68,1750.4199999999998
figured myself a pretty lucky guy plus,1750.2,5.24,1752.82

accessories she was better than a deck,1755.44,5.119,1757.9995000000001
with six Aces but I regret to report,1757.6,5.319,1760.2595
that she also knew how to handle a,1760.559,6.401,1763.7595
gun my gun before I had only suspected,1762.919,7.12,1766.479

money I'd won and I never refuse a lady,1776.88,4.919,1779.3395

one rap led to,3358.88,6.439,3362.0995000000003
another anyway I was never able to make,3360.92,4.399,3363.1195000000002

saying there I was besieged on all sides,3569.24,5.839,3572.1594999999998
the citizens to the front the howling,3573.039,4.401,3575.2395
investors behind me the sheriff's men,3575.079,8.121,3579.1395
closing in but I remained oned smiling,3577.44,8.599,3581.7395
secure in my rights what,3583.2,6.04,3586.22
happened here I am okay break it up,3586.039,5.441,3588.7595
let's try to get some sleep why I like,3589.24,4.16,3591.3199999999997
to hear Spencer talk we've talked too,3591.48,4.04,3593.5
much already there are ears all over,3593.4,5.919,3596.3595
this drum and they all belong to one,3595.52,3.799,3597.4195
guy what's the answer to it are we going,3599.68,3.919,3601.6394999999998
to have to keep every prisoner in,3602.4,2.159,3603.4795
solitary other prisons must have these,3604.559,3.921,3606.5195000000003
same problems but they clear them up,3606.839,3.321,3608.4995
keep things running smoothly we've been,3608.48,3.8,3610.38
through difficult times before War oh,3610.16,5.199,3612.7594999999997
never like this and Mum is coming,3612.28,6.64,3615.6000000000004
tomorrow why why can't he let me,3615.359,6.801,3618.7595
alone everything's gone,3618.92,7.08,3622.46
wrong I don't know who to blame,3622.16,6.919,3625.6195
but I do know that every prisoner hates,3626.0,10.559,3631.2795
us not us me it's me they hate I wonder,3629.079,7.48,3632.819
why you put on a guard's uniform and see,3639.28,5.68,3642.1200000000003
how much they love,3642.119,2.841,3643.5395000000003
you you talk to the prisoners over a,3645.0,4.359,3647.1795
loudspeaker I talk to them with the club,3647.28,4.2,3649.38
you only make the rules I have to,3649.359,3.841,3651.2795
enforce them maybe it's the way you,3651.48,3.96,3653.46
enforce them,3653.2,3.32,3654.8599999999997
is oh I'm not criticizing monay it's,3656.52,7.36,3660.2
just that but you are and perhaps you're,3660.28,6.0,3663.28
right all I know is that I've tried to,3663.88,5.56,3666.6600000000003
do my job as I saw it but if I'm the,3666.28,5.44,3669.0
cause of this trouble if I'm wrong and,3669.44,4.76,3671.82
those convicts are right then you can,3671.72,5.48,3674.4599999999996
have my resignation immediately no manzi,3674.2,4.32,3676.3599999999997
that's just what the inmates would like,3677.2,3.76,3679.08
no no that's not the answer as you said,3678.52,3.76,3680.4
we've been through some difficult times,3680.96,3.68,3682.8
together here well we're still here and,3682.28,3.72,3684.1400000000003
we're still,3684.64,6.32,3687.7999999999997
together let's uh leave it that way,3686.0,4.96,3688.48
H situation seems to call for a,3691.2,7.599,3694.9995
drink Warden thanks I,3694.839,7.641,3698.6594999999998
uh I'm going to turn in good night don't,3698.799,7.04,3702.319
be discouraged Warden it's a rule in all,3702.48,6.72,3705.84
the best stories everybody always lives,3705.839,5.561,3708.6195
happily ever,3709.2,4.24,3711.3199999999997
after good,3711.4,5.04,3713.92
you don't believe I meant what I said,3717.64,4.0,3719.64
about resigning do you doctor in a,3719.119,3.561,3720.8995
wrong I really want to help the,3726.92,6.119,3729.9795
warden just that he's,3729.64,6.199,3732.7394999999997
confused he doesn't know that kindness,3733.039,4.52,3735.2990000000004
is actually,3735.839,4.081,3737.8795
weakness and weakness is an infection,3737.559,4.24,3739.679
that makes a man a follower instead of a,3739.92,4.96,3742.4
leader seems to me a very great leader,3741.799,6.52,3745.059
once said the meek shall inherit the,3744.88,6.32,3748.04
earth science contradicts that,3748.319,5.681,3751.1594999999998
doctor nature proves that the weak must,3751.2,5.599,3753.9995
die so that the strong may,3754.0,4.52,3756.26
cleverness,3760.359,3.841,3762.2795
imagination those are the real,3762.4,3.919,3764.3595
differences between,3764.2,6.28,3767.3399999999997
men I walk amongst these convicts these,3766.319,9.201,3770.9195
thieves and murderers alone un,3770.48,8.92,3774.94
armed but they respect,3775.52,3.88,3777.46
me they obey,3780.0,7.44,3783.72
me fits you doesn't it,3783.52,6.4,3786.72
h the warden's,3787.44,6.919,3790.8995
chair it fits you you're drunk why not,3789.92,8.52,3794.1800000000003
I'm a very ordinary man I get drunk on,3794.359,6.44,3797.5789999999997
Whiskey what makes you,3798.44,6.48,3801.68
drunk Tower you flatter me doctor I'm,3800.799,5.961,3803.7795
just a policeman I carry out the,3804.92,3.359,3806.5995000000003
orders did he ever order you to crucify,3808.279,4.961,3810.7595
prisoners were you ordered to make,3813.24,4.48,3815.4799999999996
convict liser hang himself what are you,3815.48,4.879,3817.9195
talking about you were seen going into,3817.72,5.599,3820.5195
List's cell and you were seen coming out,3820.359,5.561,3823.1394999999998
what happened in between did you censor,3823.319,5.401,3826.0195
his mail wouldn't he give you any,3825.92,5.199,3828.5195
information or did you tell him a few,3828.72,4.559,3830.9995
lies about his,3831.119,5.081,3833.6595
you better stop drinking doctor your,3836.2,5.04,3838.72
imagination's working over,3838.92,5.0,3841.42
time visiting cells is part of my job,3841.24,5.0,3843.74
helps me keep tabs on the men in that,3843.92,5.359,3846.5995000000003
way I can control them control them you,3846.24,6.119,3849.2994999999996
mean torture them don't you the more,3849.279,5.241,3851.8995
pain you inflict the more pleasure you,3852.359,5.0,3854.859
get that's why you'd never resign from,3854.52,5.72,3857.38
this prison where else would you find so,3857.359,7.48,3861.0989999999997
many helpless flies to stick pins into,3860.24,7.76,3864.12
you talk to me like that if I didn't,3864.839,5.801,3867.7395
keep you here you'd be starving you,3868.0,5.92,3870.96
surgical butcher for me it's the last,3870.64,4.88,3873.08
anyway but for you it's just a beginning,3875.52,4.519,3877.7795
it why you're genas Khan Alexander the,3880.039,6.481,3883.2795

force Brute,3946.16,5.159,3948.7394999999997
congratulations force does make leaders,3951.319,6.04,3954.339
but you forget one,3955.24,5.23,3957.8549999999996
thing it also destroys,3957.359,25.641,3970.1794999999997

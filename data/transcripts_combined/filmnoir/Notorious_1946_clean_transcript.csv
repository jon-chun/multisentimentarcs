don't know if she'll do it what do you,1583.84,2.319,1584.9995
mean you don't think she'd,1585.12,2.24,1586.2399999999998
you haven't discussed it with her have,1586.159,2.64,1587.479
you no i didn't know what the job was,1587.36,2.799,1588.7595

she wouldn't do it,1590.159,2.321,1591.3195
well i don't think she's that type of,1591.279,2.561,1592.5595
woman she strikes me as me i'll,1592.48,4.64,1594.8
understand your attitude,1593.84,3.28,1595.48
why do you think she won't do it well,1597.44,3.52,1599.2
she's had no experience,1599.52,4.08,1601.56
oh come now what experience does she,1600.96,4.0,1602.96
like do you think,1603.6,2.8,1605.0
she's never been trained for that kind,1604.96,3.52,1606.72
of work let's see through her miss euban,1606.4,3.6,1608.2
was chosen not only because her father,1608.48,3.199,1610.0795
gives her an ideal background but,1610.0,2.0,1611.0
sebastian knows her,1612.0,3.039,1613.5195
oh yes he was once in love with her,1615.279,4.241,1617.3995
oh i didn't know that i don't see why,1620.0,3.76,1621.88
we're arguing about petty things like,1622.24,3.52,1624.0
this we've got important work to do,1623.76,3.84,1625.68
sebastian's house is a cover-up for,1625.76,3.36,1627.44
whatever this farm and group's up to,1627.6,2.559,1628.8795
here in rio,1629.12,2.4,1630.32
we've got to get ms hooverman inside,1630.159,2.721,1631.5195
that house and find out what's going on,1631.52,1.68,1632.36
yes that's right so i think you'd better,1633.2,3.2,1634.8
go back to ms huberman and explain to,1634.799,2.801,1636.1995
her what she has to do,1636.4,4.639,1638.7195000000002
i uh what is it nothing sir,1637.6,5.36,1640.28
oh i thought you were gonna say,1641.039,3.841,1642.9595
something how is the meeting to be,1642.96,4.0,1644.96
arranged oh well we've discussed that i,1644.88,2.64,1646.2
riding club would be the best place,1647.52,3.84,1649.44
sebastian usually rides there in the,1649.76,3.12,1651.32
so the rest is up to you and miss,1652.88,3.919,1654.8395
okay devlin that's all all right,1657.039,12.801,1663.4395

what did they say hope it isn't done too,1678.799,3.281,1680.4395
much because they caught fire once,1682.08,5.92,1685.04
i think it's better if i cut it up out,1686.08,4.24,1688.1999999999998
here unless you want a half of one to,1688.0,3.84,1689.92

sort of thing going on every day,1698.799,3.441,1700.5194999999999

the worst thing about business is it,2136.88,3.92,2138.84
makes you feel old and look old,2138.48,4.0,2140.48
you seem to have escaped all of that,2140.8,3.12,2142.36
four years of dumbness and,2142.48,2.879,2143.9195
disintegration,2143.92,3.919,2145.8795
awful alex you look younger than you did,2145.359,3.281,2146.9995
in washington,2147.839,2.561,2149.1195
it's a temporary improvement entirely,2148.64,3.52,2150.4
due to your presence my dear,2150.4,4.8,2152.8
you always affected me like a tonic,2152.16,4.88,2154.6
but perhaps now with you here in rio,2155.2,3.6,2157.0

captain prescott intelligence man he's,2177.44,3.28,2179.08
down here as part of the washington,2179.44,2.399,2180.6395
the american embassy is loaded with them,2181.839,5.121,2184.3995
they're rather handsome in there i'm,2186.96,4.639,2189.2795
allergic to american agents,2188.88,4.479,2191.1195000000002
their fine points don't particularly,2191.599,3.52,2193.3590000000004
appeal to me you really bothered you,2193.359,3.681,2195.1994999999997
since you came down,2195.119,5.121,2197.6795

trial to get away from their snooping,2205.68,6.48,2208.9199999999996
i wondered why you left your father,2208.48,3.68,2210.32
for he insisted he was so unselfish he,2212.64,3.76,2214.52
kept worrying about me begging me to,2214.96,3.76,2216.84
i had no idea he was going to die many,2219.119,4.321,2221.2795
things have died for all of us,2221.76,6.64,2225.0800000000004
we mustn't let our spirit die with them,2223.44,6.639,2226.7595

ages travel does not mean anything,2611.92,4.56,2614.2000000000003
anymore it goes so sweet,2614.4,5.919,2617.3595
one has the feeling of pronunciation,2616.48,5.599,2619.2795
we can expect rocket ships to be,2620.319,3.601,2622.1195
carrying us along the ocean,2622.079,5.361,2624.7595
very soon you can expect many strange,2623.92,5.84,2626.84
a good movie this afternoon no i was,2627.44,3.2,2629.04
disappointed,2629.76,2.96,2631.2400000000002
it must have been accommodated you know,2630.64,4.0,2632.64
hey loves to go to the movies to cry,2632.72,4.639,2635.0395
it's very sentimental at each end before,2634.64,4.56,2636.92
we get really swift and perfect,2637.359,4.0,2639.359
forever it takes nearly as long to go,2639.2,4.159,2641.2794999999996
from the city to the airport as it,2641.359,8.48,2645.5989999999997
does to cause,2643.359,6.48,2646.5989999999997
i'm afraid gentlemen that something must,2658.4,4.0,2660.4
be done about emile,2659.92,5.6,2662.7200000000003
i don't know it was an understandable,2662.4,4.0,2664.4
man was tired now it's a very dangerous,2666.4,4.08,2668.44
this is not the first one there have,2670.48,3.44,2672.2
been several other lapses before,2672.0,4.64,2674.32
there'll be more if you permit them,2673.92,5.199,2676.5195
that's bad it's very bad,2676.64,3.92,2678.6
i don't think gentlemen you can leave it,2679.119,3.121,2680.6795
to me to find some way,2680.56,3.519,2682.3195
when you drive up to patrols their old,2682.24,3.44,2683.9599999999996
wine squad a bit,2684.079,4.161,2686.1595
it is very high there are some very,2685.68,5.439,2688.3995
awkward turns,2688.24,4.4,2690.4399999999996
i'm sure i will not have any difficulty,2691.119,3.281,2692.7595
in getting emil to give me a lift in his,2692.64,2.719,2693.9995
it's quite a trick to jump clear i'll,2695.359,6.401,2698.5595
just have to be careful that is all,2698.72,7.119,2702.2794999999996
to an anchor the last time,2701.76,4.079,2703.7995
madam says will you join the others or,2713.839,4.641,2716.1594999999998
will you take your coffee in here,2716.079,4.161,2718.1595
well i think we'll take off in here i,2718.48,3.92,2720.44
i'm very sorry gentlemen to make such an,2723.119,4.801,2725.5195000000003
exhibition,2726.4,5.36,2729.08
a nonsense be all that nerves,2727.92,6.08,2730.96
you have been overworking don't you,2731.76,4.24,2733.88
you need to rest your health is very,2736.0,4.0,2738.0
important to us oh that's very,2738.48,2.8,2739.88
considerate,2740.0,4.4,2742.2
i am very tired so now i,2741.28,5.68,2744.1200000000003
think perhaps if if you make my pardon,2744.4,3.04,2745.92
ladies alex for my leaving so early then,2747.44,5.36,2750.12
maybe emil it would be bad if i came,2750.56,3.279,2752.1995
i think perhaps if you try to drive,2753.839,3.121,2755.3995
yourself all the way up to metropolis it,2755.359,4.161,2757.4395
might be too much for you,2756.96,6.159,2760.0395
i shall drive you no,2759.52,5.2,2762.12
now that would be too much for you all,2763.119,3.041,2764.6395
that way that's too much to ask,2764.72,6.0,2767.72
nonsense i'd love to go come on emil,2766.16,7.919,2770.1195
good night gentlemen good night alex,2770.72,5.44,2773.4399999999996

but his criticism of your talents,4707.12,3.36,4708.8

are married to an american agent,4710.48,4.08,4712.5199999999995

there must be no suspicion of her of you,4740.48,4.48,4742.719999999999
she must be allowed to move about freely,4744.96,4.96,4747.44
but she will be on a leash,4747.6,6.48,4750.84
she will learn nothing further to inform,4749.92,8.56,4754.2
she must go but it must happen slowly,4754.08,7.52,4757.84
if she could become ill and remain ill,4758.48,4.48,4760.719999999999

yourself mrs uh sebastian,4818.96,4.88,4821.4
that sand the devlin brought in shows,4821.84,3.44,4823.56
uranium ore,4823.84,3.52,4825.6
so now we know what we're driving at and,4825.28,3.76,4827.16
your job from now on will be to try to,4827.36,2.16,4828.44
find out where that sand comes from the,4829.52,4.88,4831.96
location of the uranium deposit has a,4832.48,3.52,4834.24
vast importance and we're putting quite,4834.4,2.96,4835.879999999999
a few people on it,4836.0,4.32,4838.16
but i think uh you'll be a great help,4837.36,3.76,4839.24
but that isn't the main reason why i,4841.12,3.36,4842.8
asked you to come up here this afternoon,4842.639,5.04,4845.159000000001

about a week,4849.28,5.2,4851.88
mr devlin's been transferred to spain,4850.8,7.839,4854.7195
to spain does mr devlin know that oh yes,4854.48,4.88,4856.919999999999

he thought he was going stale here,4861.84,4.879,4864.279500000001
uh he wants to leave rio yes i guess he,4864.159,4.161,4866.2395
thought he'd find,4866.719,4.96,4869.199
spain more interesting yes i imagine it,4868.32,4.24,4870.44
there really isn't very much for a,4872.56,3.599,4874.3595000000005
brainy fellow like mr devlin to do in,4874.0,3.28,4875.64
rio anymore,4876.159,2.48,4877.398999999999

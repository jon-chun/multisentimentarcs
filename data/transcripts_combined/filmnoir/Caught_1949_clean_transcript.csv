with your husband,12.4,4.56,14.68
yes doctor i will some doctor he is,13.28,5.6,16.08
he's a very good doctor i think you,16.96,3.28,18.6
better come in,18.88,11.84,24.799999999999997
do you often chat with mrs rodecki and,30.72,4.88,33.16
the other mothers no not often,32.399,5.281,35.039500000000004

give lorraine elocution lessons,37.68,5.68,40.519999999999996
yes why well mr radecki has a thick,40.079,3.921,42.039500000000004
foreign accent,43.36,2.4,44.56
and mrs redeck is afraid yes i know all,44.0,2.879,45.4395
about that but wasn't there some other,45.76,2.4,46.96
reason something about if lorraine,46.879,3.041,48.399499999999996
learned to speak well and walk well and,48.16,3.36,49.839999999999996
do half a dozen other things well she'd,49.92,3.52,51.68
end up by marrying well,51.52,3.519,53.279500000000006
and that that's the most important thing,53.44,4.4,55.64
in a girl's life is that what you said,55.039,4.0,57.039
yes i said that now,57.84,3.6,59.64
look your beliefs are your own business,59.039,3.84,60.959
until you start pumping them into my,61.44,4.079,63.479499999999994
patients then they become my business,62.879,5.841,65.7995
but you get these ideas anyway,65.519,5.321,68.1795
is it your burning ambition to marry a,68.72,3.759,70.59949999999999
what is it is that,72.479,6.64,75.79899999999999
is that our daughter do you want this,76.159,4.561,78.43950000000001
job permanently,79.119,3.601,80.9195
yes well you act as there's a temporary,80.72,3.36,82.4
stop gap for you,82.72,3.439,84.4395
you're typing you're filing all your,84.08,4.0,86.08
desk work haven't improved one iota in,86.159,4.241,88.27950000000001
the two weeks you've been here,88.08,4.399,90.2795
i'm sorry oh why don't you do something,90.4,3.12,91.96000000000001
i don't want to irritate you by bringing,93.52,3.52,95.28
up your personal standards again,95.28,3.28,96.92
but you're letting them slop over into,97.04,3.36,98.72000000000001
your work leonora,98.56,3.68,100.4
you're a receptionist in a doctor's,100.4,3.28,102.04
office on the east side,102.24,4.4,104.44
not a host is on park avenue where you,103.68,5.28,106.32000000000001
treat your patients where you,106.64,4.88,109.08
for pete's sake look at that hairdo,108.96,4.24,111.08
you're so fancy you're scaring people,111.52,3.36,113.2
they may be poor but they're patients,114.88,3.919,116.8395
and we want them well you can keep them,116.479,3.68,118.319
if everything i do is wrong i might as,118.799,11.041,124.3195
stupid what she's a stupid girl,140.959,7.201,144.5595
who i criticized her work so she got mad,145.2,3.92,147.16
okay well the work was bad,149.12,5.199,151.7195
was it the point is she isn't really,152.239,3.841,154.1595
stupid she could be quite good,154.319,4.481,156.55949999999999
if she wanted to be well put the ad in,156.08,5.04,158.60000000000002
the paper again,158.8,4.64,161.12
but she wanted to ask her to come back i,161.12,3.28,162.76
didn't fire him,163.44,3.92,165.4
she quit what's the matter with that,164.4,4.479,166.6395
you don't suppose there's anything the,168.879,3.841,170.7995

next time she comes into this office,631.519,5.681,634.3595
cut off those awful curls and you know,634.0,4.8,636.4
how she could cure that stomach trouble,637.2,2.56,638.48
by sending her mother to a good,639.76,3.28,641.4
psychiatrist,641.12,4.8,643.52
any temperature no she says it's normal,643.04,6.799,646.4395

grab a taxi and get over to the city,666.16,3.28,667.8
drug store,667.92,3.52,669.68

have this filled and meet me up with,679.68,4.88,682.12
rideki's right away okay,681.12,3.44,682.84
that light's a little bright for our,702.64,14.879,710.0794999999999
eyes find something to shade,704.16,16.799,712.5595
i'm afraid it's botulism yeah that's a,717.519,5.281,720.1595
doctor's fancy word for a very bad kind,720.959,2.801,722.3594999999999
of food poisoning,722.8,8.56,727.0799999999999
through jesus yes tell not to cheese,723.76,12.24,729.88
mama means will she get all right,731.36,6.96,734.84
i don't know i think so but i don't know,736.0,3.04,737.52
you're so busy telling me i'm why she's,739.04,2.88,740.48
sick so you haven't got time to come and,740.639,3.361,742.3195000000001
see for yourself,741.92,3.599,743.7194999999999
that canned meat that she had this,744.0,2.639,745.3195
morning must have been the cause of the,745.519,1.841,746.4395
anyone else eat it tilly no,747.36,12.479,753.5995
is there any left the kitchen window,750.959,8.88,755.399
i'll give her another injection every,769.2,5.04,771.72
six hours until it takes effect,770.56,3.68,772.4
if it takes effect it will,776.72,4.72,779.08
even when you treat cases like this,780.0,5.12,782.56
immediately 18 of those treated die,781.44,5.199,784.0395000000001
i know all the statistics i'm a very,785.12,3.44,786.84
good textbook doctor,786.639,4.721,788.9995
what's the matter grenada i slipped up,788.56,4.32,790.7199999999999
just because lorraine's always had,791.36,2.96,792.84
stomach trouble i assume that's what it,792.88,2.16,793.96
was this time,794.32,3.12,795.88
a doctor has no right to assume anyone,795.04,3.44,796.76
can make a mistake,797.44,2.88,798.8800000000001
not when it comes to a kid's life i,798.48,3.12,800.04

protect you to hear you,808.959,4.641,811.2795

from the moment we married,2128.88,4.16,2130.96
that's pretty mild i hated myself for,2130.32,4.32,2132.48
being such a fool,2133.04,3.52,2134.8
i never wanted you in the first place,2134.64,3.52,2136.4
the more you fought me the more i began,2136.56,3.279,2138.1995
to dislike you,2138.16,4.8,2140.56
i think now i hate you all i care about,2139.839,4.641,2142.1594999999998

responsible for the dying cold doctor,2865.92,2.72,2867.28
well don't worry about it if my,2867.52,2.72,2868.88
diagnosis is correct she won't want that,2868.64,2.56,2869.92
dimapur is the only planes track in the,2903.839,5.121,2906.3995
otherwise hilly state of nagaland,2906.319,5.681,2909.1594999999998
and is well connected by air and rail,2908.96,4.8,2911.36
from major cities like,2912.0,4.8,2914.4
delhi kolkata and guwahati and even,2913.76,5.359,2916.4395000000004
though it lacks the luxurious malls,2916.8,5.36,2919.48
and plush cinema halls like gohati and,2919.119,4.321,2921.2795
other big cities,2922.16,3.84,2924.08
it's pure joy to explore the local,2923.44,4.79,2925.835
bazaars of the mapur,2926.0,5.2,2928.6
so with the majority of locals here who,2931.2,3.28,2932.8399999999997
fresh local produce these weekly markets,2934.48,6.639,2937.7995
are quite popular in fact they're held,2937.92,4.32,2940.08
different locations every day of the,2942.24,3.599,2944.0395
within dimapur so the most,2945.839,5.921,2948.7995
famous one here is the wednesday,2949.44,3.679,2951.2795
supermarket,2951.76,5.04,2954.28
and it's located about one kilometer,2953.119,6.831,2956.5345
away from the dhimapur railway station,2956.8,7.05,2960.3250000000003
and the next popular place to hang out,2968.0,4.079,2970.0395
is the chumo bazaar,2970.559,4.481,2972.7995
at chumo kidima which is located about,2972.079,7.841,2975.9995000000004
13 kilometers from the main city center,2975.04,4.88,2977.48
so friends uh to be frank pretty much,2982.72,5.359,2985.3995
every market is similar with its fair,2985.599,3.921,2987.5595000000003
share of fresh produce,2988.079,4.881,2990.5195000000003
vegetables and meats and most,2989.52,5.21,2992.125
importantly apparel,2992.96,3.04,2994.48
loads and loads of reject seconds,2996.0,3.599,2997.7995
i mean these are really quite good and,2999.599,6.321,3002.7595
seriously affordable i mean if you're a,3002.88,5.439,3005.5995000000003
backpacker and would like a change of,3005.92,3.36,3007.6
deemapura is definitely the place to,3009.28,6.559,3012.5595000000003
shop without breaking the,3012.16,3.679,3013.9995
see this bank,3025.28,2.559,3026.5595000000003

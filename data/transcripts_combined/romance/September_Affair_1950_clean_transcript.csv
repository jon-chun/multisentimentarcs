there must have been an easier approach,1328.419,4.541,1330.6895000000002
I doubt it the emperor was afraid of,1331.039,3.061,1332.5695
you go first David oh we've made it I,1337.48,5.14,1340.05
think when I was a boy I wanted to be an,1340.94,3.06,1342.47
this was supposed to be the favorite,1345.44,4.619,1347.7495000000001
hangout of Emperor Tiberius what did he,1347.179,5.461,1349.9095
do up here well he probably watched the,1350.059,5.221,1352.6695
sunsets and wondered if his wife was,1352.64,5.519,1355.3995
really above reproach,1355.28,5.279,1357.9195
over playing full of punctual people,1358.159,4.52,1360.419
aren't you because they haven't met you,1360.559,5.1,1363.109
sorry anonymously this is the best time,1362.679,5.081,1365.2195000000002
I've had in years sounds a little sad,1365.659,3.601,1367.4595000000002
what have you been doing I'm making,1367.76,3.84,1369.68
money took me 16 years to build up my,1369.26,4.32,1371.42
factory until it runs itself and raises,1371.6,4.199,1373.6995
Sun whom I hardly ever see,1373.58,4.979,1376.0694999999998
kept busy all my life then one day I,1375.799,4.74,1378.1689999999999
woke up and began to wonder what's it,1378.559,4.62,1380.869
all for where do I come in and then you,1380.539,4.801,1382.9395
decided to take a trip alone that's,1383.179,4.641,1385.4995000000001
transportation system is growing a,1389.6,3.72,1391.4599999999998
little impatient what do they think they,1391.82,3.839,1393.7395
are horses oh you're a snob some of my,1393.32,5.599,1396.1195
best friends are donkeys,1395.659,3.26,1397.2890000000002
oh Mr engineer,1403.659,4.9,1406.1090000000002
the thing that makes us go up so slowly,1406.4,6.36,1409.5800000000002
and down so fast gravity,1408.559,4.201,1410.6595
oh what a lovely day thank you so much,1420.559,5.1,1423.109
didn't you say you came to Italy to,1423.14,5.34,1425.8100000000002
visit a friend my old piano teacher,1425.659,5.101,1428.2095000000002
she's been like a mother to me,1428.48,3.96,1430.46
look there's one more thing will you do,1430.76,3.96,1432.74
me a favor yes well the next time I,1432.44,3.54,1434.21
ordered spaghetti floating in butter,1434.72,3.0,1436.22
when you take the plate and pour it over,1435.98,4.799,1438.3795
my head if you win no excuse of me,1437.72,5.04,1440.24
puffing like an old locomotive just from,1440.779,3.601,1442.5795
climbing a little car from now it is,1442.76,3.6,1444.56
going to be less good morning exercise,1444.38,4.08,1446.42
for me starting in the morning with a,1446.36,5.54,1449.1299999999999
swim before breakfast all right,1448.46,3.44,1450.18
good night good night,1460.9,4.56,1463.18
you're having said a thing for 15,1474.08,5.04,1476.6
minutes what do you want me to say oh,1476.179,5.281,1478.8195
something stupid something to bore me,1479.12,4.32,1481.28
but we've been here for two days and you,1483.44,4.32,1485.6000000000001
haven't said a word or done anything I,1485.539,3.781,1487.4295
didn't like you guys hit me at the,1487.76,3.299,1489.4095
Bayshore Country Club and being awful,1489.32,4.92,1491.78
boy and the proper surrounding,1491.059,5.521,1493.8195
you live in Bayshore I know we spend our,1494.24,4.38,1496.43
summers there,1496.58,4.94,1499.05
it's nothing like this,1498.62,2.9,1500.07
we had any sense at all we can write,1501.86,5.12,1504.4199999999998
back to Naples,1504.14,2.84,1505.5600000000002
that was entirely premeditated,1512.0,6.659,1515.3295
I didn't think it was gravity,1514.96,5.86,1517.89
and I don't think I should make it,1518.659,3.26,1520.2890000000002
I like the way you handle people,1521.919,6.301,1525.0695
including myself,1525.32,2.9,1526.77
you missed our plane and you said,1529.22,4.14,1531.29
wouldn't it be wonderful to spend a few,1530.9,5.899,1533.8495
days in Capri's friends,1533.36,3.439,1535.0794999999998
let's keep it that way,1537.14,3.26,1538.7700000000002
hello I brought with me an old Capri,1551.96,7.38,1555.65
remedy for sunburn okay ready thank you,1555.62,6.32,1558.78

I'm going to Naples David tonight you,1569.36,5.36,1572.04

wrong thing,1577.4,5.159,1579.9795000000001
no use I can't go and pretend,1579.62,5.52,1582.3799999999999
attending pretending that after tonight,1582.559,5.401,1585.2595

friends will say goodbye nice to have,1587.96,4.68,1590.3
met you had a happy time and,1590.659,3.481,1592.3995000000002
our separate way,1594.14,2.96,1595.6200000000001
I'm falling in love with you,1603.14,3.5,1604.89
I never wanted to hear anything so much,1607.1,4.64,1609.4199999999998
in my life,1609.32,2.42,1610.53
because novel could be met but it would,1612.14,5.58,1614.93
be our fault if we stayed together you,1615.14,5.7,1617.99
have a wife in your own own life and I'm,1617.72,5.22,1620.33
afraid I've always wanted,1620.84,3.86,1622.77
All or nothing,1622.94,4.5,1625.19
I don't want just to feel stolen hours,1624.7,5.44,1627.42
and you're not free well I thought I was,1627.44,5.64,1630.26
but it was going to be when I when I,1630.14,5.48,1632.88
left for Europe we decided on a divorce,1633.08,4.699,1635.4295
let's make it right if and when you're,1637.779,4.841,1640.1995
free we can start all over again three,1640.52,3.659,1642.3495
days ago I could have asked you to marry,1642.62,4.34,1644.79
me today I can't,1644.179,2.781,1645.5695
when you first saw me in the travel,1648.399,3.121,1649.9595
this is a letter I was reading just just,1651.52,5.58,1654.31
the last part,1654.44,2.66,1655.77
now I know I cannot give you the divorce,1657.94,4.18,1660.03
you asked for,1660.62,3.779,1662.5095
I was too hurt into prayer to refuse or,1662.12,5.58,1664.9099999999999
I agreed at the time I realized your,1664.399,4.921,1666.8594999999998
feeling for me is no longer what it used,1667.7,2.579,1668.9895000000001
we are too many things in common to,1670.279,4.201,1672.3795
break apart now,1671.899,4.38,1674.089
more than anything I'm thinking of our,1674.48,4.1,1676.53
don't forget that we do have a son,1679.52,3.86,1681.45
he loves you too and she's loved you a,1683.419,3.901,1685.3695
lot longer than I have Manina just,1685.399,3.861,1687.3294999999998
loving somebody isn't enough,1687.32,4.44,1689.54
we never made each other happy isn't,1689.26,3.94,1691.23
that important,1691.76,5.039,1694.2795
I can't think like that she's your wife,1693.2,6.26,1696.3300000000002
and I'm not,1696.799,2.661,1698.1295
what time is the steamer Leaf enabled,1700.34,5.699,1703.1895

everything goes all right we ought to be,1722.62,4.419,1724.8294999999998
in New York tomorrow night it's hard for,1724.88,3.72,1726.74
me to imagine after so many years,1727.039,3.481,1728.7795
walking up Fifth Avenue not many people,1728.6,4.86,1731.03
New York a few let's find out what's,1730.52,4.2,1732.62

statistics it's safer to fly than stay,1751.82,3.599,1753.6195

happened between here and Madrid before,1774.14,3.36,1775.8200000000002
they noticed our absence they left the,1775.279,5.361,1777.9595
cable immediately way down,1777.5,3.14,1779.07
how many do you want two,1795.98,5.22,1798.59
one of my agents and one for my music,1798.38,4.5,1800.63
teacher in Florence,1801.2,3.9,1803.15

out soon enough I only need one,1805.1,4.459,1807.3294999999998
as Mark Twain said the reports of my,1827.0,4.26,1829.13
deaths are greatly exaggerated you know,1829.039,4.041,1831.0595
no David don't say it you thought it too,1833.08,5.92,1836.04
you know what we're thinking is,1837.559,4.22,1839.6689999999999
impossible why to the world we're dead,1839.0,4.98,1841.49
out of millions of people we're the,1841.779,4.441,1843.9995
we're the only ones who have this chance,1843.98,5.22,1846.59
would we be happier,1846.22,5.02,1848.73
you said terribly cruel to the others,1849.2,4.219,1851.3095
four days they've given us up,1851.24,4.5,1853.49
it's a miracle that we are here we're,1853.419,3.941,1855.3895
only alive because we wanted to be,1855.74,2.96,1857.22
David I'm frightened not too much for,1858.7,5.199,1861.2995
myself but what I'd be giving up,1861.86,4.02,1863.87
wouldn't be very important but you they,1863.899,4.14,1865.9689999999998
need you I wouldn't be honest if I went,1865.88,3.96,1867.8600000000001
back now feeling the way I do you saw,1868.039,3.0,1869.539
her letters you'll never give me a,1869.84,2.64,1871.1599999999999
divorce we'd live like strangers the,1871.039,4.161,1873.1195
rest of our lives,1872.48,2.72,1873.84
I was always too busy he was away at,1878.32,5.199,1880.9195
school next year he goes to college and,1881.0,4.5,1883.25
then he takes my place at the planning,1883.519,3.321,1885.1795
of a fine life,1885.5,3.539,1887.2695
I was younger when I lost my father,1886.84,4.9,1889.29
perhaps they don't need you but,1889.039,6.02,1892.049
are you sure that you won't need them,1891.74,8.159,1895.8195
I only want you but,1895.059,4.84,1897.479
all right I'm selfish this time I'm,1900.2,4.74,1902.57
thinking of myself you know you're wrong,1901.88,5.76,1904.7600000000002
I only know that pay you to saved us,1904.94,5.339,1907.6095

wonderful happy life,1910.279,6.12,1913.339
the only question we must answer is,1913.46,5.839,1916.3795
do we love each other,1916.399,7.341,1920.0694999999998
you have the slightest doubt about that,1919.299,4.441,1921.5194999999999
sign my name to the cable and send it,1924.26,3.98,1926.25
oh isn't this perfectly beautiful,1994.039,6.181,1997.1295

as they swallow see it on the journey to,2016.419,5.041,2018.9395000000002
the South another minute is going to,2019.12,5.12,2021.6799999999998

David Owen definitely I hope that means,2092.76,5.22,2095.3700000000003
good morning Mr Morrison good morning,2108.3,4.72,2110.6600000000003
Jim did you give Mrs Lawrence my message,2110.619,5.601,2113.4195
she's expecting you stay,2113.02,3.2,2114.62
hello David good morning Charles,2117.099,4.381,2119.2895000000003
how's your mother,2120.22,3.359,2121.8995
well she's all right she's a little too,2121.48,4.02,2123.4900000000002
brave for my benefit I'm afraid she,2123.579,3.601,2125.3795
don't let herself cry she'd feel better,2125.5,4.02,2127.51
I agree with you what is she,2127.18,5.04,2129.7
in dad's room,2129.52,4.86,2131.95
from your message I gathered that you,2132.22,4.32,2134.3799999999997
had something urgent to say well it's,2134.38,3.479,2136.1195000000002
not really urgent,2136.54,3.48,2138.2799999999997
if it's something disturbing I wish,2137.859,4.381,2140.0495
you'd tell me instead of her I'm old,2140.02,4.26,2142.15
enough to handle I believe you are but,2142.24,3.42,2143.95
this is something between Catherine and,2144.28,3.559,2146.0595000000003
morning Catherine to us,2153.94,6.179,2157.0295
I asked him to pack David's things but,2156.599,4.841,2159.0195000000003
I've changed my mind I don't want to,2160.119,3.421,2161.8295000000003
give him away,2161.44,5.0,2163.94
I could finish this later,2167.22,3.78,2169.1099999999997
let's go in the other room I just met,2171.66,5.14,2174.23
David Junior outside,2174.82,4.259,2176.9495
he's a wonderful boy I'm lucky to have,2176.8,5.039,2179.3195
him especially now,2179.079,4.381,2181.2695000000003
Catherine do you mind if I ask a,2181.839,3.361,2183.5195
personal question of course not Charles,2183.46,6.26,2186.59
you're my lawyer was your marriage happy,2185.2,4.52,2187.46
for a long time it was,2190.3,4.14,2192.3700000000003
why well some things come up I don't,2192.28,3.299,2193.9295
understand,2194.44,3.8,2196.34
do you know anyone by the name of Maria,2195.579,6.54,2198.849
salvatini or did David ever mention her,2198.24,5.02,2200.75
not that I can remember that's what I,2203.26,3.96,2205.2400000000002
thought you see David had a special,2205.359,4.201,2207.4595
account set aside for charity a check,2207.22,4.139,2209.2895
for a very large sum has been drawn,2209.56,4.559,2211.8395
against it payable to this woman,2211.359,5.841,2214.2795
he met in Italy,2214.119,3.081,2215.6595
signature is genuine I saw it myself,2220.42,4.26,2222.55
as your lawyer I must advise you that,2222.7,4.44,2224.9199999999996
you have the right to stop payment,2224.68,3.96,2226.66
it's David's money he earned it,2228.64,5.64,2231.46
was his wish it should be paid very well,2231.76,4.98,2234.25
you asked me if my marriage was happy,2236.74,6.26,2239.87
no it wasn't not recently,2239.32,3.68,2241.1600000000003
great deal in the past few years,2244.3,5.52,2247.0600000000004
everything that was,2247.599,4.881,2250.0395000000003
prison to him,2249.82,2.66,2251.15
he said perhaps after 18 years people,2252.88,4.68,2255.2200000000003
should set each other free,2255.4,3.9,2257.35
to find out if they still loved each,2257.56,3.18,2259.15
but otherwise marriage would end up,2260.74,4.32,2262.8999999999996
being a contract nothing more he wanted,2262.78,5.28,2265.42
a divorce yet,2265.06,5.58,2267.85
how must I give it to him but I couldn't,2268.06,5.7,2270.91
in my last letter I told him,2270.64,6.06,2273.67
my marriage is my life,2273.76,6.68,2277.1000000000004
I couldn't experiment with my life,2276.7,3.74,2278.5699999999997
was I selfish Charles to try to hold on,2282.28,4.079,2284.3195
to him you have nothing to approach,2284.5,3.96,2286.48
yourself for Catherine well I'm not so,2286.359,4.341,2288.5295
maybe I lacked faith in David,2290.92,4.439,2293.1395
maybe I should have given him his,2293.859,3.921,2295.8195
maybe he would have come back to me,2297.82,6.06,2300.8500000000004
I was afraid of losing him he was on his,2301.119,5.821,2304.0295
way back yes but was he coming back to,2303.88,4.92,2306.34
fulfill a contract,2306.94,4.8,2309.34
or to insist on the divorce,2308.8,5.819,2311.7095000000004
no I never know,2311.74,4.98,2314.2299999999996
what was that woman's name again Maria,2314.619,4.381,2316.8095000000003
salvatini she lives in Florence do you,2316.72,5.639,2319.5395
want me to find out more about her no,2319.0,5.339,2321.6695
not now anyway,2324.339,3.081,2325.8795
I have a lot of time jobs,2328.42,3.8,2330.32
I thought you were an engineer,2357.839,4.02,2359.849
yes how do you like it,2363.42,4.48,2365.66
you need a compass to find it,2365.68,4.02,2367.69
but that's what you want obviously,2367.9,4.32,2370.06
where's my Nina she's in the house oh,2369.7,3.96,2371.68
don't tell her about the piano it's,2372.22,4.619,2374.5294999999996
supposed to be a surprise the surprise I,2373.66,5.28,2376.2999999999997
could hear you a mile away,2376.839,5.641,2379.6594999999998
crazy Americano,2378.94,3.54,2380.71
oh you weren't supposed to be here until,2396.66,6.22,2399.77
tomorrow oh everything's doing an awful,2399.22,6.72,2402.58
mess being a woman and unpredictable I,2402.88,5.04,2405.4
came today,2405.94,5.34,2408.61
what's that oh that's Bianca she comes,2407.92,4.86,2410.35
from a little village there's no anyone,2411.28,3.96,2413.26
in Florence those are his children and,2412.78,4.62,2415.09
she doesn't speak a word of English very,2415.24,3.48,2416.9799999999996
you've only been dead a week and already,2418.72,4.379,2420.9094999999998
you have an unreachable house and an,2420.819,5.161,2423.3995
unspeakable sound perfect oh,2423.099,4.621,2425.4095
everything's perfect except the view,2425.98,4.139,2428.0495
which is more and perfect comes look,2427.72,5.3,2430.37
there's all the flowers,2430.119,2.901,2431.5695
so you're giving up your concert,2446.88,5.32,2449.54
years of work that's over God,2449.859,4.681,2452.1994999999997
Dave is now tossing everything overboard,2452.2,5.639,2455.0195
and you call this a new life,2454.54,5.64,2457.36
to me it's a suicide fact,2457.839,4.74,2460.209
you didn't say that when we arrived,2460.18,4.62,2462.49
I was so happy you were alive that I,2462.579,4.921,2465.0395000000003
couldn't think clearly now I can,2464.8,5.039,2467.3195
not because I'm Wiser than you and David,2467.5,3.359,2469.1795
because I've lived a little longer,2470.859,5.281,2473.4995
it won't work Manina,2474.099,4.381,2476.2895000000003
what you're doing is selfish cowardly,2476.14,3.42,2477.85
the poor foundation for happiness,2479.56,4.68,2481.9
cowardly because we have the courage to,2481.9,4.439,2484.1195000000002
start again or more selfish because we,2484.24,3.54,2486.0099999999998
don't want to hurt anyone,2486.339,3.421,2488.0495
or wrong because we're happy,2487.78,4.62,2490.09
how long will this happiness last as,2489.76,5.7,2492.61
long as we love each other,2492.4,6.38,2495.59
and have you for a friend,2495.46,3.32,2497.12
it's not your key writing g flat dragon,2508.079,6.24,2511.199
David What a Beautiful piano oh thank,2516.359,4.72,2518.719
you I have one condition that you've,2519.4,3.6,2521.2000000000003
probably had to practice too much it's a,2521.079,5.101,2523.6295
deal Gracie,2523.0,3.18,2524.59
it has charm even though I don't,2530.26,5.099,2532.8095000000003
approval of him I'm self-kind and,2532.96,6.92,2536.42
thoughtful thoughtful but,2535.359,7.621,2539.1695
I don't care what you do Medina as long,2539.88,5.62,2542.69
as you're not fooling yourself,2542.98,4.44,2545.2
I want you to know that when I was a boy,2545.5,5.54,2548.27
of six I had a voice like Lily Paul,2547.42,5.54,2550.19
what is it,2551.04,3.6,2552.84
the band called me this morning to say,2554.64,5.14,2557.21
the check went through good now you can,2557.14,5.699,2559.9894999999997
start your Brave New Life well provided,2559.78,4.4,2561.98
by the old one,2562.839,3.901,2564.7895
but what if someone in New York wonders,2564.18,4.6,2566.48
why you made me such an unusually,2566.74,4.32,2568.8999999999996
generous gift huh my wife would never,2568.78,5.819,2571.6895000000004
question that no,2571.06,6.66,2574.39
she sounds like a splendid woman,2574.599,5.941,2577.5695
but even so what about paper passports,2577.72,4.56,2580.0
our passports are good for a couple of,2580.54,4.26,2582.67
years yet Bianca solved the name,2582.28,4.14,2584.3500000000004
question she insists on calling him,2584.8,3.539,2586.5695
Senor Lorenzo,2586.42,5.46,2589.15
and if Lorenzo runs into an old friend,2588.339,6.48,2591.5789999999997
who knows it very simple liar grow a,2591.88,6.9,2595.33
beard on the spot I give up I knew this,2594.819,6.601,2598.1195
visit would be useless at least I got it,2598.78,4.5,2601.03
off my chest you wouldn't be my old,2601.42,4.74,2603.79
Maria if you hadn't well you'll make me,2603.28,5.52,2606.0400000000004

work unless we absolutely honest we,2630.339,4.441,2632.5595
mustn't lie ever even for the sake of,2632.859,5.76,2635.739

tooth is no position to demand,2759.88,4.439,2762.0995000000003
Perfection how would you like to read,2762.04,3.9,2763.99

bringing an Italian chick to Florence,3180.359,4.801,3182.7595

ladies could go home and make coffee,3512.04,4.759,3514.4195
another old family tradition,3513.559,5.621,3516.3695000000002
is the corporal's problem of all,3516.799,4.181,3518.8894999999998
straightened out,3519.18,4.46,3521.41

fatherly advice,3523.64,4.719,3525.9995
who do you think I have no idea,3528.359,4.341,3530.5295

when I saw you with Johnny I,3563.42,5.32,3566.08
I suddenly fell down but you must miss,3566.7,6.859,3570.1295
your son all the things you've given up,3568.74,4.819,3571.1495

of the large company decides to take a,3610.319,4.321,3612.4795
vacation you approve of my trip you,3612.059,4.321,3614.2195

what must be accepted but if you really,3616.38,4.32,3618.54
want to go Italy is as beautiful country,3618.72,3.119,3620.2794999999996

the boy happy that you're taking him,3621.839,3.901,3623.7895
with you oh he'd be very cross if he,3623.76,4.68,3626.1000000000004
heard you say that he's taking me,3625.74,5.4,3628.4399999999996

woman in Florence I'm right,3642.839,4.74,3645.209
that unanswered question still torments,3645.359,3.48,3647.0989999999997
why did David decide to come home,3648.839,5.041,3651.3595
perhaps you can give me the answer does,3651.599,4.381,3653.7895000000003
your son know about her yes he's very,3653.88,4.199,3655.9795
much against my seeing him,3655.98,6.68,3659.32
probably right yes probably,3658.079,4.581,3660.3695000000002
where is this galatario of yours oh,3756.059,6.78,3759.449
taking a walk alone no the children of,3759.0,4.799,3761.3995
he wouldn't want to be alone he might,3763.799,5.04,3766.319
have to think Maria you seem to have a,3766.26,4.319,3768.4195000000004
fixed idea that we're destined to be,3768.839,3.78,3770.729
unhappy but I've told you a hundred,3770.579,4.201,3772.6795
times and yourself a thousand times no,3772.619,3.801,3774.5195000000003
you know why you're irritable no why,3776.42,6.28,3779.56
because he is the irritable,3780.599,4.561,3782.8795
that's understandable it's a new life,3782.7,5.22,3785.31
for both of us and we have to get used,3785.16,4.199,3787.2594999999997
you're wrong Manila,3789.359,6.68,3792.699
this is no lie for either of you,3792.0,4.039,3794.0195
at least he's still coming home,3797.46,3.8,3799.36
you've done some time for dinner how,3808.76,4.839,3811.1795
about a drink fine hello Maria hello I,3810.9,4.5,3813.15
was just making my weekly inspections,3813.599,3.301,3815.2495000000004

he seems completely happy he wasn't that,3819.539,5.881,3822.4795000000004
way this morning David where have you,3822.72,4.8,3825.12
been down by the river,3825.42,6.24,3828.54
I ran into an old love of my day,3827.52,6.72,3830.88
did she recognize you well she couldn't,3831.66,6.24,3834.7799999999997
she was hanging in the air what most men,3834.24,5.46,3836.97
at some time in their lives have a,3837.9,4.919,3840.3595
weakness for acrobats this was a turbine,3839.7,6.659,3843.0294999999996
my own factory look,3842.819,6.061,3845.8495
I had no idea your factory was so large,3846.359,4.141,3848.4294999999997
that's only the administration building,3848.88,3.719,3850.7395
the machine shops and railroad yards,3850.5,3.66,3852.33
warehouses out and back to my office,3852.599,3.661,3854.4295
where I pilot with Windows doesn't it,3854.16,4.02,3856.17
make you homesick oh no I've spent,3856.26,4.38,3858.4500000000003
enough time there that should ruin your,3858.18,4.56,3860.46
shipping department and send them the,3862.74,3.059,3864.2695
wrong model they were having a terrible,3864.48,3.0,3865.98
time with it but I gave my hand it's,3865.799,4.141,3867.8695
working all right now even got paid the,3867.48,4.139,3869.5495
young engineer in charge gave me a drink,3869.94,3.78,3871.83
of wine I had a wonderful day because of,3871.619,3.72,3873.4790000000003
the turbine or because of the wine,3873.72,3.599,3875.5195
neither because of a big idea I got to,3875.339,3.661,3877.1695
thinking of the river out there and the,3877.319,4.381,3879.5095
miles of barren land and the poverty and,3879.0,4.92,3881.46
what could be done with turbines and,3881.7,3.72,3883.56
the way we did in California in,3885.42,3.419,3887.1295
Tennessee why don't you get in touch,3886.74,4.859,3889.1695
with your young engineer he gave me his,3888.839,4.381,3891.0295
card I'm going to write him a note that,3891.599,3.541,3893.3695000000002
maybe you'll mail it for me on the way,3893.22,3.599,3895.0195
you seem to forget,3903.92,7.08,3907.46
Don Quixote lost his battle,3906.359,4.641,3908.6794999999997
Avante Pietro okay well this whole thing,3912.839,4.801,3915.2395
is approximate which is scale senior,3915.96,3.42,3917.67
patini except where I leaned against the,3917.64,2.76,3919.02
to build a dam one would have to divert,3920.4,4.26,3922.53
the river well we blast two diversion,3922.14,4.439,3924.3595
tunnels through rocker Mountain like we,3924.66,4.86,3927.0899999999997
did on the Colorado River right here is,3926.579,6.181,3929.6695
volcanic loose rocks cutting a tunnel,3929.52,5.339,3932.1895
creates slides well we had a similar,3932.76,4.14,3934.8300000000004
problem with Grand Coulee and we solved,3934.859,3.72,3936.719
it by sinking Refrigeration pipes into,3936.9,3.179,3938.4895
the mountain and temporarily freezing,3938.579,3.96,3940.559
its solid we could pour concrete into,3940.079,5.76,3942.9590000000003
these slopes to hold them it was amazing,3942.539,5.101,3945.0895
we leave mountains in rivers where God,3945.839,3.841,3947.7595
put them we move them where they do the,3947.64,3.959,3949.6195
most good just think how much work could,3949.68,3.24,3951.2999999999997
have been saved if the world had been,3951.599,3.181,3953.1895
created by an engineer this entire,3952.92,4.58,3955.21
region is now semi-arid it could be made,3954.78,4.98,3957.27
prosperous and fertile and and,3957.5,4.78,3959.89
self-supporting just an idea but who,3959.76,4.02,3961.7700000000004
knows someday something might happen to,3962.28,3.299,3963.9295
it would you care to help me I would be,3963.78,2.819,3965.1895000000004

oh they should be here as soon as Maria,3980.339,3.78,3982.229
sent for them the day you're after and,3981.96,3.48,3983.7
in the meantime do you think you could,3984.119,3.361,3985.7995
spare a couple of minutes to look at me,3985.44,4.2,3987.54
the Verano four rounds is all close the,3991.079,4.321,3993.2395

to visit the place as my husband did,4279.26,2.88,4280.7
before he died,4280.64,4.44,4282.860000000001

or cream a cream with no sugar please,4285.08,6.3,4288.23
I'm probably wondering how I became the,4288.92,3.96,4290.9
object of your husband's great,4291.38,4.859,4293.8095
generosity oh please Madam my visit had,4292.88,5.279,4295.5195
nothing to do with that,4296.239,4.44,4298.459
my son begged me not to come here,4298.159,5.221,4300.769499999999
he was afraid I'd be hurt even more,4300.679,4.261,4302.8095
but I couldn't leave without having,4303.38,3.839,4305.2995
talked to you is that your son outside,4304.94,4.88,4307.379999999999

I'm sorry I can't tell you more about,4315.739,4.741,4318.1095
your husband you don't have to really,4317.54,4.679,4319.8795
I've learned a great deal just from,4320.48,3.3,4322.129999999999
meeting you,4322.219,4.201,4324.3195
see I'd imagined you differently,4323.78,5.64,4326.599999999999
you mean younger,4326.42,5.279,4329.0595
when David left for Europe he wasn't,4329.42,4.08,4331.46
very happy,4331.699,3.48,4333.438999999999
his life had become a tiresome,4333.5,3.3,4335.15
obligation to it,4335.179,3.361,4336.8595000000005
even his home,4338.54,4.74,4340.91
he seemed to be searching for something,4340.82,5.1,4343.37
another kind of life,4343.28,4.74,4345.65
when I heard your name I thought he'd,4345.92,3.12,4347.4800000000005
you're a very unusual person Mrs,4349.04,3.54,4350.81
most women couldn't bear the idea of,4352.58,5.28,4355.22
someone taking away them and even for a,4355.1,4.74,4357.47
I was that kind of woman,4359.84,5.66,4362.67
when David was alive,4362.3,3.2,4363.900000000001
do you know why he suddenly decided to,4369.62,3.9,4371.57
come back to America he had intended to,4371.3,3.78,4373.1900000000005
stay longer,4373.52,4.26,4375.650000000001
afraid I don't if I could be sure that,4375.08,5.04,4377.6
he took that pain of his own accord and,4377.78,4.56,4380.0599999999995
not because of a letter I wrote him I,4380.12,5.039,4382.6395
wouldn't have this horrible feeling,4382.34,5.64,4385.16
being responsible,4385.159,5.401,4387.8595
I have so much to be grateful for,4387.98,4.44,4390.2
a wonderful son,4390.56,3.96,4392.54
a name I'm proud of,4392.42,5.64,4395.24
Independence I I have everything,4394.52,6.24,4397.64
except peace of mind,4398.06,4.619,4400.369500000001
I wish I could give you the answer you,4400.76,3.479,4402.4995
so want to hear,4402.679,4.341,4404.8495
but I can't,4404.239,2.781,4405.6295
I thank you for your kindness,4407.36,4.44,4409.58
I'll see you to the door no please don't,4409.64,4.519,4411.8995
goodbye Mrs Lawrence goodbye and forgive,4416.96,6.14,4420.03
me for the interruption,4420.199,2.901,4421.6494999999995
in my whole life I've never been so,4437.239,3.361,4438.9195
liars and cheats that's what we are,4440.6,4.38,4442.79
please Maria don't make it worse for me,4442.82,3.78,4444.71
you want me to pity you because you have,4446.6,3.9,4448.55
to spend a few embarrassing minutes it's,4448.4,4.62,4450.71
not your wife he saw it for it's her,4450.5,5.219,4453.1095
why did she go back on her word why,4453.02,4.139,4455.0895
didn't she give David the freedom he,4455.719,3.601,4457.5195
asked for now that she thinks he's dead,4457.159,3.961,4459.139499999999
it's easy to be generous,4459.32,3.54,4461.09
but if she knew the truth she'd be just,4461.12,3.599,4462.9195
as selfish as before,4462.86,4.68,4465.2
Manina this woman is David's wife and,4464.719,4.741,4467.0895
she made him miserable and I'm making,4467.54,5.159,4470.1195
him happy do you really believe that you,4469.46,4.62,4471.77
we are happy and he loves me and I love,4474.08,3.84,4476.0
and nothing will ever part us now I do,4477.92,6.08,4480.96
feel sorry for you,4480.98,3.02,4482.49

your work after you've made your,4661.94,3.0,4663.44
succession,4663.44,3.779,4665.3295
I gave it up before that's right I never,4664.94,4.86,4667.37

opportunity to mention your project what,4696.199,3.241,4697.8195

insurmountable but you said yourself,4718.159,3.301,4719.809499999999
there are no difficulties that cannot be,4719.9,2.64,4721.219999999999
I was too optimistic in my first,4722.54,4.679,4724.8795
enthusiasm that I got some books and,4724.4,5.48,4727.139999999999
checked and,4727.219,2.661,4728.5495
do it it's too big a job I don't want to,4732.44,4.86,4734.87
get involved besides uh,4734.239,6.601,4737.5395
well I I came at a rest not to work so,4737.3,4.74,4739.67
you want to please perhaps you can,4740.84,2.399,4742.0395
convince him because that's how,4742.04,4.02,4744.05

own decisions I beg you to reconsider or,4746.06,5.099,4748.6095000000005
Mr Duncan wants us to talk to you I know,4748.88,4.2,4750.9800000000005
I know once you get into this sort of,4751.159,3.361,4752.8395
thing you can't pull out I've had,4753.08,3.599,4754.8795
experience with government jobs plenty,4754.52,4.38,4756.71
of headaches and red tape and very,4756.679,4.381,4758.8695
little money it's not worth it bringing,4758.9,4.44,4761.12
prosperity to an entire region is not,4761.06,4.98,4763.55
worth it Senor yes but not for me I've,4763.34,4.92,4765.8
worked enough I'm sorry for a teeny to,4766.04,4.02,4768.05
put you on a spot I hope you understand,4768.26,4.5,4770.51
there's not enough money in government,4772.76,4.14,4774.83
you didn't have to do that,4782.239,3.5,4783.989
David what is it well George Duncan and,4789.44,4.86,4791.87

at least the children had fun with a,4803.12,4.22,4805.23
and that portini carry them out you,4807.739,4.021,4809.7495
could stay in the background oh that's,4810.199,3.841,4812.1195
impossible a project like this calls for,4811.76,3.959,4813.739500000001
a man with connections and friends who,4814.04,3.119,4815.5995
trust his judgment he'd have to go to,4815.719,3.181,4817.3095
Washington talk to senators and pull,4817.159,3.54,4818.929
strings a man who could call on the,4818.9,4.5,4821.15
experience and success of a lifetime a,4820.699,6.181,4823.7895
man like you yes oh there must be,4823.4,5.16,4825.98

dear David,5133.659,4.201,5135.759499999999

finding out that you're alive,5137.86,5.1,5140.41
I've tried to feel hurt and angry and,5140.4,3.7,5142.25
by overwhelming happiness my deep,5144.1,4.32,5146.26
gratitude to God,5146.32,6.3,5149.469999999999
has erased all such Petty thoughts,5148.42,6.779,5151.8095

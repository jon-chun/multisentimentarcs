"To begin with, all the incidents and characters in this story...",2.45,3.031,3.9655000000000005
might be fictitious...,5.545,1.81,6.45
and any resemblance to you or me...,7.425,2.089,8.4695
might be purely coincidental.,9.579,2.483,10.820500000000001
The name of the town isn't important.,13.364,1.841,14.284500000000001
It's the one that's just 28 minutes from the big city...,15.275,2.212,16.381
23 if you catch the Morning Express.,17.549,2.39,18.744
"It's on a river, and it's got houses and stores and churches...",20.007,3.548,21.781000000000002
and a Main Street.,23.617,1.903,24.5685
Nothing fancy like Broadway or Market.,25.589,1.964,26.570999999999998
Just plain Main.,27.621,1.842,28.541999999999998
"Drugs, dry goods, shoes...",29.533,1.81,30.438000000000002
those horrible little chain stores that breed like rabbits.,31.414,3.879,33.353500000000004
"Also a street for the upper, the exclusive of the town...",35.357,3.361,37.0375
where the country-club set live when they're not at the country club.,38.785,3.145,40.357499999999995
This is the first Saturday in May...,42.001,2.576,43.288999999999994
and tonight the first dinner dance of the country-club season.,44.64,3.548,46.414
"Well, anyway, this house belongs to Brad and Deborah Bishop...",53.643,3.144,55.215
two of my dearest friends.,56.859,2.151,57.9345
Brad bought this house before he went to war.,59.073,2.452,60.299
It was Brad who gave me my first black eye and...,61.592,2.513,62.8485
and my first kiss.,64.17,2.483,65.4115
"Well, when he came home from the war, he came home with a wife... Deborah.",66.719,4.086,68.762
Thomasino said to tell you he found room for your briefcase in the bag.,77.636,3.144,79.208
Good for Thomasino.,80.852,2.027,81.8655
- Why'd you have him pack a bag? - Because I know these Saturday conferences.,82.945,3.062,84.476
A bit like Saturday poker games... don't plan on doing anything Sunday.,86.07,3.268,87.704
"It's strange, your not letting me know when you plan to be away overnight.",89.407,3.144,90.979
"This is just in case, darling. There's no telling how late it'll be.",92.622,3.144,94.194
And I like my own pajamas between me and the sheets in a Turkish bath.,95.838,3.424,97.55
"You'll phone this afternoon, though, either way, won't you?",99.327,2.027,100.34049999999999
"And leave word, even if I'm not here?",101.42,1.873,102.3565
Just where might you be when I call if not here?,103.362,1.81,104.267
"First Saturday in May, remember? The Settlement House Picnic.",105.242,2.296,106.39
That's right. The Women's Club thing. Like it?,107.609,2.213,108.71549999999999
Anything to do with kids. You know that.,109.884,1.995,110.8815
What are you wearing tonight?,111.947,2.212,113.053
I've got the one you liked so much in Vogue.,117.472,2.028,118.48599999999999
- But if you're staying in town... - What color?,119.565,2.607,120.8685
"Black, like you said. Brad, I don't want to go without you.",122.234,2.877,123.6725
"Darling, it's the first dinner dance of the season.",125.178,1.841,126.0985
- If I only knew you were gonna be there. - I will be if I can...,127.089,2.576,128.377
"and if I can't, why should that throw you into a panic?",129.729,2.089,130.7735
"What are you afraid of, anyway, Deborah?",131.882,2.264,133.014
"- Good morning, Thomasino. - Morning, Mr. Bishop.",137.408,1.995,138.4055
I'm not in a panic.,143.257,1.841,144.1775
"Well, then?",145.168,2.42,146.37800000000001
It's just that suddenly the thought of going to that dance tonight without you...,147.655,3.425,149.3675
- Brad? - Hmm?,155.634,2.42,156.844
"Addie Ross... she used to be sort of your ideal, wasn't she?",158.121,2.969,159.6055
Now how did Addie get into this conversation?,161.156,1.995,162.1535
I never knew you read Vogue. I never thought men bothered much about it.,163.218,3.486,164.96099999999998
What's Vogue got to do with it? I told you I picked it up on the train coming home one night.,166.768,3.361,168.4485
- Some woman had left it behind. - Some woman.,170.195,2.059,171.2245
"Yes, some woman. I thumbed through it and saw a dress I thought would look smart on you.",172.32,3.423,174.0315
What's wrong with that?,175.808,2.027,176.8215
"Nothing, I guess. Nothing at all.",177.901,2.027,178.9145
"- I should hope not. - Well, I've gotta pick up Rita.",179.995,2.968,181.479
"- You'll phone about tonight, won't you? - I told you I would.",183.027,2.39,184.22199999999998
It just so happens that the dress I bought...,187.761,1.934,188.728
that you picked out of Vogue that some woman happened to leave on the train...,189.763,2.42,190.973
is exactly the dress that Addie Ross wore to the concert two weeks ago!,192.25,3.393,193.9465
"Hot toast, Mr. Bishop.",199.44,1.842,200.361
She won't stay mad at him long. She's too much in love.,206.509,3.599,208.30849999999998
"Pretty soon, she'll be full of self-reproach.",210.178,2.09,211.22299999999998
Women are so silly.,212.334,3.599,214.1335
"Now, this is that street where people on the way up and on the way down...",216.276,2.638,217.595
live alongside each other for awhile.,218.977,2.027,219.9905
Rita and George Phipps are on their way up...,221.07,1.902,222.021
"that is, if Rita has her way.",223.041,1.811,223.9465
"And that's the only way she'll have any part of, thank you.",224.923,2.544,226.195
"There she is now. Ready, waiting. That's Rita.",227.531,3.175,229.1185
Hi. You're late. I won't be a minute.,243.153,1.81,244.058
Just one last look at the twins and I've gotta give Sadie her check.,245.034,2.844,246.456
On behalf of the underprivileged children of this town...,257.17,2.027,258.18350000000004
I'd like to thank you over-privileged ladies...,259.262,1.811,260.1675
for sharing your excess privileges with us.,261.143,1.966,262.126
"There's something odd-looking about you today, George.",263.177,2.451,264.40250000000003
Just that usual two-headed schoolteacher look.,265.694,2.483,266.9355
"You're all dressed up. Saturday, no school, and you're all dressed up.",268.243,2.544,269.515
Just my little old blue serge.,270.852,2.12,271.912
First Saturday of trout season. Brad says ever since you were big enough lift a fish...,273.036,4.117,275.0945
Shh. Listen closely.,277.223,2.12,278.283
Can you hear the grateful murmur of the trout as they whisper in the brooks and streams?,279.407,3.661,281.23749999999995
"This is what they whisper: ""Phipps will not fish today.""",283.138,3.175,284.72549999999995
Mm. You're cute. But why?,286.384,1.995,287.3815
Because I've got something better to do.,293.222,2.607,294.52549999999997
Have a nice day.,295.893,1.84,296.813
"Debby, darling, we'll have to stop station. I've just got to get my copy off on the 8:42.",302.202,3.879,304.1415
Do you mind?,306.147,1.933,307.1135
What's George being so mysterious about?,314.612,2.781,316.0025
I wouldn't know. It seems we're not talking.,317.463,2.266,318.596
"- Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, it's just one of those things.",319.8,1.871,320.7355
It'll be all right. Why? Was he acting strangely?,321.74,3.0,323.24
"Mm. Not exactly. Well, it's only he's not going fishing and being all dressed up.",324.805,4.002,326.806
All dressed up?,328.869,2.576,330.15700000000004
"Why, so he is. His blue suit.",331.509,2.482,332.75
On Saturday of all things. And no fishing. Hmm.,334.057,4.003,336.05850000000004
The radio hasn't been fixed yet.,338.122,2.327,339.2855
Oh. And they've just gone on the air.,340.519,2.699,341.8685
"Oh, well. Save myself listening to the murder of my little brainchild.",343.28,3.33,344.945
"Rita, why on earth do you do it? Five of those radio programs every week.",346.677,3.176,348.26500000000004
Up until dawn almost every night.,349.923,1.81,350.828
Because each week I receive in return 100 pieces...,351.804,2.483,353.04549999999995
"of what Addie Ross calls ""the most restful shade of green in the worid.""",354.352,2.782,355.743
Unquote. Addie again.,357.204,1.811,358.1095
"Why is it that sooner or later, no matter what we talk about...",359.086,2.699,360.4355
we wind up talking about Addie Ross?,361.846,2.212,362.952
Maybe it's because if you giris didn't talk about me...,364.121,2.421,365.3315
you just wouldn't talk at all.,366.609,1.81,367.51399999999995
That's right. I'm Addie.,368.489,2.607,369.79249999999996
I'm the one theyjust can't help talking about.,371.16,2.389,372.35450000000003
My very dearest friends too.,373.616,2.39,374.811
"You know, I wonder if she knows how much we do talk about her.",376.074,3.454,377.801
And what we say and how we feel about her.,379.593,2.121,380.6535
"I know. Believe me, I do.",381.777,2.296,382.925
And it doesn't matter.,384.143,1.841,385.0635
It doesn't matter nearly as much as what all of you don't know... yet.,386.054,3.662,387.885
"- Morning, Mrs. Hollingsway. - Haven't the others gotten here yet?",421.284,2.482,422.525
"No. You're the very first, the early bird.",423.832,2.028,424.846
"- I've taken it upon myself to get the children aboard. - Oh. Good idea, Miss Hawkins.",425.926,3.268,427.56
"So that when the other ladies arrive, we'll be all ready to go.",429.263,2.576,430.551
Fine. If they'll only get here.,431.903,1.902,432.85400000000004
"Oh, I'm sorry we're late. Rita had to go by the station.",443.887,2.42,445.097
"Oh, sure. See anyone there you know?",446.374,1.81,447.279
- Just a husband of mine running like mad. Why? - Nobody else?,448.255,3.144,449.827
Where's Addie? Weren't you supposed to pick her up?,451.47,1.903,452.42150000000004
"Nothing's happened to her, I hope.",453.442,1.965,454.4245
Addie Ross left town this morning.,455.476,2.75,456.851
Left town?,458.296,2.121,459.3565
"Well, what do you mean, ""left town""?",460.481,1.758,461.36
"She certainly could've told someone, at least phoned.",462.301,2.212,463.407
"- She's left for good. - Then it must've been something sudden, some emergency.",464.576,3.517,466.33450000000005
What makes you so sure it's for good? How do you know?,468.156,2.212,469.262
"Well, the doorman told me she subleased her apartment last week...",470.431,2.421,471.6415
and yesterday she sold her car.,472.919,1.81,473.82399999999996
So much for your sudden emergency.,474.799,2.058,475.828
If that isn't just like her. Why do you suppose she had to keep it such a big secret?,476.923,3.724,478.785
Who knows why Addie does or doesn't do anything?,480.715,2.783,482.1065
"I've got a letter for the Mesdames Bishop, Hollingsway and Phipps.",497.487,3.331,499.15250000000003
"From the dear departed, I'll bet.",500.885,2.213,501.9915
Addie's so tactful. She even puts us in alphabetical order.,503.16,2.969,504.64450000000005
"- Open it up. - No, let's wait.",509.987,2.212,511.093
- For what? - Till we get back. Knowing Addie...,512.262,2.09,513.3069999999999
"I mean, why let her spoil our day?",514.416,1.934,515.383
Not my day. Addie Ross never saw the day she could spoil my day.,516.418,3.848,518.342
Did I put enough days into that?,520.332,1.903,521.2835
"Dearest Debby, Lora Mae and Rita.",524.246,2.812,525.6519999999999
"As you know by now, you'll have to carry on without me from here.",527.127,3.456,528.8549999999999
It isn't easy to leave a town like our town...,530.646,2.668,531.9799999999999
"to tear myself away from you three dear, dear friends who have meant so much to me.",533.376,4.125,535.4385
And so I consider myself extremely lucky...,538.714,1.903,539.6655000000001
to be able to take with me a sort of memento.,540.686,2.782,542.077
Something to remind me always of the town that was my home...,543.537,3.548,545.311
and of my three very dearest friends...,547.148,2.668,548.482
whom I want never to forget.,549.878,2.244,551.0
And I won't.,553.124,1.841,554.0445
"You see, giris, I've run off with one of your husbands. Addie.",555.035,3.786,556.928
"If that's her idea of a joke, it's in extremely poor taste.",558.888,2.968,560.3720000000001
"If I ever catch up with that character, I'll...",561.922,2.09,562.967
"Ladies, may I suggest... The captain seems to think...",567.292,2.999,568.7915
"Well, he's been rude about it.",570.356,2.843,571.7775
"Well, looks like Addie has crowned one of us Queen of the May.",636.0,3.331,637.6655
I think it's laughable.,639.398,1.841,640.3185
- Okay. Laugh. - Ha.,641.309,1.996,642.307
"Deborah didn't happen to mention why Brad had to go to the city, did she?",643.372,3.361,645.0525
He hasn't missed a Saturday on that golf course since they got the snow off the greens.,646.8,3.518,648.559
"All right, kids. Get 'em while they're red hot.",654.102,2.783,655.4934999999999
It's gonna be a real restful day.,661.14,1.811,662.0455
Nothing to think about except the picnic and the weenie roast...,663.021,2.327,664.1845
and coming home.,665.417,1.81,666.322
"Oh, that. Kathleen's going to read us a fairy story.",667.298,3.972,669.284
Fairy story? My favorite kind. I grew up on them.,671.333,3.3,672.983
Only I wrote my own.,674.7,2.027,675.7135000000001
"May I start now, Mrs. Bishop?",676.794,2.389,677.9884999999999
"If you're ready, Kathleen. Of course.",679.251,2.027,680.2645
"- ""Once..."" - Once.",681.344,2.213,682.4505
"""Once upon a time, there lived a very poor girl...",683.619,4.489,685.8635
"""who was very beautiful.",688.169,2.577,689.4575
"She was so beautiful...""",690.809,1.147,691.3824999999999
Do you remember your first night in town?,692.72,3.143,694.2915
"You and Brad, fresh out of the navy.",695.936,3.144,697.508
That was a first Saturday in May too.,699.151,3.548,700.925
- It it Brad? - Is it Brad?,702.762,2.606,704.0649999999999
- Is it Brad? - Is it Brad?,705.431,2.752,706.807
- Is it Brad? - Is it Brad?,708.253,3.237,709.8715000000001
"Here now, what's this? Conduct unbecoming and officer and a lady.",728.097,3.455,729.8245
I'm such an unholy mess!,731.616,2.028,732.63
- How? - This!,733.709,1.841,734.6294999999999
- A little too kinky maybe? - She must've set it with cement.,735.62,2.513,736.8765
Mm. Here try this. It'll take the kink out of a watch spring.,738.199,3.091,739.7444999999999
"I'm no raving beauty, heaven knows...",752.209,1.933,753.1754999999999
but I did so wanna look my miserable best tonight.,754.211,2.845,755.6335
The very first time we've gone out together all dressed up like civilians.,757.124,3.361,758.8045000000001
And you would be the one man in the worid...,763.403,1.81,764.308
that looks even better out of uniform than in.,765.283,2.577,766.5715
"Got the jumps, kid?",772.109,2.969,773.5935000000001
"It's been quite a day, that's all. Quite a change.",775.144,2.781,776.5345
"Out of the navy, out of uniform. New home, new town, new friends.",777.994,3.91,779.9490000000001
"Oh, I told that blasted girl I wanted to comb it out soft!",781.969,3.144,783.541
It's making me look even more like a farmhand than I feel.,785.185,2.751,786.5604999999999
- Easy does it. - Meeting your friends for the first time.,788.006,2.421,789.2165
You wouldn't want them to see me like this.,790.494,2.058,791.523
I should hope not. You be sure to put on a dress.,792.617,3.486,794.36
- Hey! My tie. - You can tie it again.,802.665,1.871,803.6005
There they are.,807.398,1.872,808.3340000000001
"- Brad, about my dress... you might not like it. - If you're in it, I'll love it.",811.554,4.882,813.995
It's my only one and years old. Remember there wasn't time today to get a new one...,816.499,2.999,817.9985
"and even years ago, it wasn't exactly the last word.",819.563,3.3,821.213
That was the last word. Hurry up.,822.93,1.903,823.8815

"Did you like her very much... when you grew up together, I mean.",834.216,2.999,835.7155
Rita and George were engaged at the age of five by swapping beetles.,837.279,2.938,838.748
- She was never my type. - What is your type?,840.283,2.212,841.389

"- John, where is Mrs. Ross? - I don't believe she's arrived yet, Mr. Bishop.",1572.404,4.086,1574.447
That's Addie for you. Always the right thing at the right time.,1576.561,3.972,1578.547
- Thoughtful and generous. - Generous to a fault.,1580.596,2.419,1581.8055
To a fault. That's Addie.,1583.084,2.027,1584.0975
Who is Mr. Ross?,1585.176,2.7,1586.5259999999998
Mr. Ross took a powder about five years ago.,1587.937,2.843,1589.3584999999998
No such thing. She gave him the heave-ho.,1590.849,2.151,1591.9244999999999
He went out for a paper one night and never came back.,1593.064,3.092,1594.6100000000001
Porter says Addie Ross has got class.,1596.218,2.7,1597.568
And he knows class like I know navigation.,1598.98,3.123,1600.5415
"You stick to your guns, Porter. It shows a healthy instinct.",1602.164,3.145,1603.7365
"You may call it ""class,"" but what Addie has is taste.",1605.381,2.937,1606.8495
I can buy taste. Addie's got class.,1608.383,2.514,1609.64
Taste and discrimination.,1610.962,1.81,1611.867
Women usually get them out of magazines...,1612.843,1.965,1613.8255000000001
but they're part of Addie's natural equipment.,1614.876,2.42,1616.086
"Also fog lights, white sidewalls and a heater.",1617.364,2.75,1618.739
"Isn't it fun, Deborah, when the boys all agree?",1620.184,1.997,1621.1825
On Addie Ross and George Washington... nobody else.,1622.248,2.968,1623.732
You giris put your noses back into joint. I wanna propose a toast.,1625.281,3.973,1627.2675
"First half of the glass to Deborah. Welcome home, darling.",1629.316,2.782,1630.707
- I'll drink to that. - Amen!,1632.168,2.027,1633.1815
"And the rest to our absentee hostess, Addie.",1637.052,2.513,1638.3084999999999
- Perfect. - To Addie.,1639.631,2.481,1640.8715000000002
"- Let's show 'em a flash of old Vienna. - Darling, if you don't mind...",1654.368,2.328,1655.532
- Before the floor gets crowded. - I don't think I should.,1656.765,1.903,1657.7165
"Let's get into this, George. Something tells me this is going to be quite a waltz.",1690.062,4.087,1692.1055
- Brad. - Having fun?,1698.284,1.759,1699.1635
"- Brad, listen. - Hold on, baby.",1700.105,1.81,1701.01
- Once more. - No!,1708.021,2.244,1709.143
"Deborah, what on earth have you done to yourself?",1719.216,2.937,1720.6844999999998
"Brad, let me handle this.",1729.224,2.969,1730.7085
"Uh, pardon my fingers.",1734.502,2.265,1735.6345
- Here. Drink this. - What is it?,1747.376,2.181,1748.4665
A new inner tube.,1749.62,1.903,1750.5714999999998
There you are. I think that'll be all right.,1751.593,2.875,1753.0305
"- Thank you, Miss Jenkins. - You're welcome.",1754.534,1.935,1755.5015
"Rita, will you take me home?",1759.441,2.244,1760.563
You've got the idea everybody out there is watching that door waiting for you to come out.,1761.746,3.879,1763.6855
"- Maybe not, but Brad is. - Then it's because he's worried about you.",1765.69,2.058,1766.719
It's because he's ashamed! In front of his friends...,1767.814,2.028,1768.828
"ugly and pinned up, drunk and sick.",1769.907,2.575,1771.1944999999998
"Oh, I wanted so much to be what he wanted, to do what was right, like...",1772.546,3.269,1774.1805
"like Addie Ross, the right thing at the right time.",1775.883,2.089,1776.9275
"But I didn't, I couldn't. L- I'm humiliated.",1778.037,3.03,1779.5520000000001
What happened tonight could have happened to anyone. Don't you realize that?,1786.673,3.548,1788.447
Then take my word for it.,1790.282,2.265,1791.4144999999999
"Why, there's Brad.",1808.839,3.092,1810.385
I see Addie got here after all.,1815.847,4.21,1817.952
- Is is Brad? - Is it Brad?,1820.125,2.968,1821.609
- Is is Brad? - Is it Brad?,1823.158,3.486,1824.9009999999998
- Is is Brad? - Is it Brad?,1826.707,2.668,1828.0410000000002
Is it Brad?,1829.437,4.309,1831.5915
Don't expect us back too soon.,1852.172,2.751,1853.5475000000001
We kids are going after everything from sardines to wolves.,1854.993,2.699,1856.3425
"You'll have no trouble finding wolves, honey.",1857.754,1.966,1858.7369999999999
- Almost lunchtime? - I've called a recess.,1877.049,2.906,1878.502
"When your own fingers begin to look like frankfurters, it's time for a slight rest.",1880.021,3.269,1881.6554999999998
I suppose it's occurred to you...,1883.358,3.145,1884.9305
that Lora Mae's kept herself as busy as a bird dog ever since we got here.,1886.574,2.968,1888.058
The very thought of a hike wears me out.,1889.608,1.841,1890.5285
Maybe she just doesn't wanna sit still.,1891.519,2.751,1892.8945
"You sit still, you can't help thinking, can you?",1894.34,2.213,1895.4465
"- Depends on what you think about. - Well, for instance...",1896.616,2.607,1897.9195
why your husband should suddenly decide to go to the city on a Saturday morning.,1899.286,4.085,1901.3285
- You mean Brad? - No. I meant Porter. He was at the station this morning.,1903.441,4.489,1905.6855
He nearly knocked me down when I was mailing my copy.,1907.991,2.028,1909.0049999999999
Funny Lora Mae doesn't seem to know about it.,1910.085,2.606,1911.3880000000001
Why did you think I meant Brad?,1912.755,1.81,1913.66
Maybe because it might keep you from wondering...,1914.635,1.841,1915.5555
why George dressed up on Saturday with no school.,1916.546,1.996,1917.544
"You're being a little too touchy about a perfectly inoffensive remark, seems to me.",1918.609,2.721,1919.9695
"Oh, let's stop this sudden bickering.",1921.401,1.758,1922.28
We're beginning to behave like some movie about a women's prison.,1923.221,2.719,1924.5805
Not a bad comparison at that.,1926.011,2.783,1927.4025
"- Cigarette. - No, thanks.",1928.863,1.81,1929.768
Why wouldn't George go fishing?,1940.118,1.841,1941.0384999999999
Why wouldn't George go fishing?,1942.029,5.368,1944.713
Why the blue suit?,1949.553,2.751,1950.9285000000002
Why the blue suit?,1952.374,4.427,1954.5875
He's crazy!,1963.113,2.451,1964.3385
"Sadie, doesn't that noise drive you insane?",1981.861,2.296,1983.009
"- Restful, ain't it? - ##",1984.227,2.265,1985.3595
There. That's better.,1987.837,1.811,1988.7425
"Well, the twins are fed and ready to be put away.",1989.719,2.606,1991.0220000000002
Now if George would only show up.,1992.388,1.81,1993.293
- How many canapés are you making? - Two dozen.,1994.269,1.841,1995.1895
"The way I figure it, six healthy people oughta be able to eat 2- or 300.",1996.18,2.576,1997.468
"They're just appetizers, Sadie.",1998.819,1.842,1999.74
And let's get a couple of things straight.,2000.731,1.81,2001.636
"- First, when you announce dinner... - I know.",2002.612,1.841,2003.5325
"- I'm not supposed to say, ""Soup's on!"" - How did I tell you?",2004.523,1.996,2005.521
- I forgot. - Dinner is served!,2006.586,1.872,2007.522
- Dinner is served. - And you're not to say it as though the food were poisoned.,2008.527,2.543,2009.7985
As this fancy shmancy because two people from the city are gonna eat here.,2011.136,3.361,2012.8165
Mrs. Manleigh's a very important person.,2014.564,1.933,2015.5305
"She has charge of a great many radio programs, including the one I write.",2016.565,3.425,2018.2775000000001
You know what I like about your programs.,2020.055,2.182,2021.146
"Even when I'm running the vacuum, I can understand it.",2022.3,2.638,2023.619
Thank you so much.,2025.0,1.995,2025.9975
"Now, the second thing. Does the new uniform fit?",2027.062,2.969,2028.5465
- It's kinda corny. - Wear it.,2030.097,1.871,2031.0325
Only one thing. The cap is out. Makes me look like a lamb chop with pants on.,2032.037,3.725,2033.8995
"- Oh, Sadie. - The cap is out.",2035.83,2.182,2036.9209999999998
"Sadie, please. Just this once.",2038.074,2.028,2039.088
Okay. Okay.,2040.169,2.637,2041.4875000000002
"Oh, hello, Mrs. Manleigh.",2046.782,2.42,2047.992
"No. No, not at all. I was just rereading the scripts for Monday.",2049.269,3.331,2050.9345
"What's that, Mrs. Manleigh?",2054.578,2.452,2055.804
Yes. It's a good connection.,2057.096,1.841,2058.0165
About the script?,2059.007,1.81,2059.9120000000003
"Oh. Well, I'll just have to make the revisions tonight, that's all.",2060.888,4.427,2063.1014999999998
"What? Oh, no, Mrs. Manleigh. You've just got to come.",2065.377,4.666,2067.71
I've looked forward so to your meeting George...,2070.111,1.841,2071.0315
"in line with that matter we discussed, remember, Mrs. Manleigh?",2072.022,2.359,2073.2015
"Yes, that's right.",2074.449,2.15,2075.524
He'll bejust perfect for us. You'll see.,2076.663,1.995,2077.6605
"No, don't worry about that. I always work best late at night anyway.",2078.726,5.151,2081.3015
Yes. 7:30. That'll be fine.,2083.944,2.213,2085.0505
You can tell me about the changes when you get here.,2086.219,2.213,2087.3255
"Fine. Good-bye, Mrs. Manleigh.",2088.494,2.151,2089.5695
There's George.,2090.708,2.844,2092.13
"Changes, changes. When am I supposed to sleep?",2093.621,2.637,2094.9395
"Uh, what's, uh, Mr. Phipps gonna be so perfect for on the radio?",2096.32,4.004,2098.322
"Nothing, and you keep quiet about it.",2100.385,2.545,2101.6575000000003
I will. Only he won't.,2102.995,3.144,2104.567
Good evening one and all.,2108.213,2.213,2109.3195
"- Hello, George. - Well, how now? Why the look of doom?",2110.489,4.488,2112.733
Ohhh. Did you forget to baste the ducks?,2115.039,3.547,2116.8125
Look. I don't teach you about teachin'. Don't you teach me about duck.,2118.648,3.093,2120.1945
"Oh, Sadie's been an ángel. Looks like I'll be up most of the night making revisions.",2121.803,3.03,2123.3179999999998
- Mrs. Manleigh just called. - But you're giving a dinner party for her tonight.,2124.898,2.876,2126.3360000000002
"She suggested calling it off, but I wouldn't hear of it.",2127.84,2.12,2128.9
"Why can't Mrs. Manleigh, just for once...",2130.025,2.028,2131.039
tell the sponsor to call off his wife's revisions?,2132.118,2.12,2133.178
You don't tell a sponsor things like that about his wife.,2134.302,2.451,2135.5275
"George, you... you just don't understand.",2136.821,1.964,2137.803
"No, I suppose not. Well, it may not make your bad news any better...",2138.852,3.579,2140.6414999999997
but I got good news.,2142.493,1.841,2143.4135
"Have you, darling? Oh, George, 10 of 7:00. We've gotta get dressed.",2144.404,2.813,2145.8105
- Don't you wanna hear my good news? - Of course I do.,2147.286,2.09,2148.331
- Did you get the liquor and cigarettes? - Right here.,2149.44,1.841,2150.3605000000002
"Oh, now, you check the cigarette boxes while I put the liquor away.",2151.351,4.272,2153.487
Why does everything have to be full when guests arrive?,2155.69,2.481,2156.9305
"Full cigarette boxes, candy dishes. Fresh cakes of soap.",2158.238,3.517,2159.9964999999997
"Aren't we supposed to eat, smoke or wash when we're alone?",2161.818,2.998,2163.317
- Where's the scotch? - I didn't buy any.,2164.881,2.028,2165.895
- Why not? - Too expensive. Bourbon's a better drink anyway.,2166.975,3.123,2168.5364999999997
But the Manleighs are a cinch to want scotch.,2170.16,3.207,2171.7635
"People in show business, you know what I mean. Those kind always drink scotch.",2173.436,3.207,2175.0395000000003
"Well, I know what you mean, but I wish you wouldn't say it in radio English.",2176.713,3.124,2178.275
"""That kind,"" not ""those kind.""",2179.897,2.213,2181.0035
"There are men who say ""those kind"" who earn $100,000 a year.",2182.174,3.03,2183.689
"There are men who say, ""Stick 'em up,"" who earn more. I don't expect to do either.",2185.267,3.393,2186.9635
Nor are you expected to pay for the scotch.,2188.726,1.995,2189.7235
You're quite right. Funny how it slips my mind...,2193.155,2.783,2194.5465000000004
"that in certain respects, I'm only the titular head of this house.",2196.006,2.543,2197.2774999999997
"Oh. Don't be silly, darling.",2198.616,3.175,2200.2035
I thought it very amusing to begin with.,2204.986,2.027,2205.9995
"Very, uh, modern and enlightened.",2207.08,2.512,2208.336
"My tuxedo, for instance.",2211.267,2.12,2212.3269999999998
The same tuxedo that for some strange reason you want me to wear tonight.,2213.45,2.699,2214.7994999999996
"Well, what's so wrong about getting dressed up once in a while?",2216.21,3.062,2217.741
"Nothing at all, unless it's obviously an attempt at pretense.",2219.335,3.331,2221.0005
And just what is so pretentious about tonight?,2224.644,2.12,2225.7039999999997
Tonight we'll sit down to one of Sadie's duck dinners.,2226.829,2.668,2228.163
"Present will be Porter and Lora Mae, with whom we've had many such dinners...",2229.559,2.876,2230.9970000000003
when you wore slacks and I didn't bother to shave.,2232.501,1.996,2233.4990000000003
"But this time, also present will be two advertising moguls who happen to employ you.",2234.564,4.334,2236.7309999999998
Their presence means a new uniform for Sadie...,2238.962,2.121,2240.0225
my children prisoners in their room...,2241.148,1.81,2242.0530000000003
and all the pomp and hysteria usually reserved for coronations.,2243.029,2.389,2244.2235
I call that pretense.,2245.486,1.841,2246.4065
All right. So I'm out to impress the boss.,2247.397,3.092,2248.9429999999998
"What do I get for that, 30 years?",2250.552,1.81,2251.4570000000003
"Tonight's important to me. I've planned and worked, shopped...",2252.433,2.389,2253.6275
"taken the twins off Sadie's hands, written my program...",2254.89,1.996,2255.888
and I'll be up all night tonight and it's worth it to me.,2256.953,1.903,2257.9045
And as far as dressing's concerned...,2258.925,2.264,2260.0570000000002
you can come in a cowboy suit for all I care.,2261.26,2.514,2262.5170000000003
And why do the chairs have to look as if nobody ever sat down in them?,2265.75,3.175,2267.3375
Because they do! Oh.,2270.18,2.42,2271.39
"Aw, come on, Reet. Let's cut it out.",2274.397,2.12,2275.457
you finish up down here and see if you can't relax for a few minutes.,2278.491,2.576,2279.779
- Are you all ready except for your dress? - And combing out my hair.,2281.131,2.968,2282.615
Good. I'll put the twins to bed...,2284.165,2.482,2285.406
"and call up the liquor store to send over the scotch, all right?",2286.713,2.813,2288.1195000000002
- George? - Hmm?,2293.205,2.264,2294.337
Please nojokes about radio. I'm afraid they don't have much of a sense ofhumor about it.,2295.54,4.458,2297.769
"Oh, neither have I. The time for joking about it has passed.",2300.061,3.0,2301.561
"Radio has become a very serious problem now, like juvenile delinquency.",2303.125,2.637,2304.4435
That's what I mean. Cracks like that.,2305.825,2.183,2306.9165
"Oh, that wasn't a crack. I meant it.",2308.07,2.265,2309.2025000000003
George! George!,2323.238,2.576,2324.526
"Sadie, don't open the door. It might be the guests.",2325.878,2.42,2327.088
It can't be. It's only 7:00.,2328.365,1.811,2329.2704999999996

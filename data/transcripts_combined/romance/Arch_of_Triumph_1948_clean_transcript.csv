the winter of 1938 was one year before,116.32,6.159,119.39949999999999
the beginning of the second world war,119.04,6.0,122.04
and paris was still an island of light,122.479,5.361,125.1595
in the darkness of europe,125.04,5.999,128.0395
and everywhere men saw the new european,127.84,4.56,130.12
the refugee and on the streets,132.4,6.16,135.48000000000002
political refugees rubbed shoulders with,136.4,4.96,138.88
the refugees from life,138.56,4.88,141.0
and no one cared if these men and women,141.36,4.64,143.68
lived or died,143.44,6.08,146.48

comfortable people only it will not last,4096.799,5.121,4099.3595
long in cold border towns,4099.92,4.399,4102.1195
filthy sellers without money not enough,4101.92,3.52,4103.68
not one place where you can sleep safe,4105.44,5.12,4108.0

unhappiness if you'd find me blind drunk,4795.28,5.439,4797.9995
everything would have been in good taste,4798.239,3.281,4799.8795
the fact that,4800.719,2.801,4802.1195
i played chess and went to sleep is,4801.52,5.84,4804.4400000000005
proved that i'm crude and unfeeling,4803.52,3.84,4805.4400000000005

some guilty,5068.239,14.881,5075.679499999999
i think we have had enough of this party,5083.12,3.2,5084.72
want to take walk no don't be so,5086.32,3.76,5088.2

getting dark outside and dream,5138.08,3.599,5139.8795
do you like it you haven't seen the rest,5139.679,3.601,5141.4795
one feels quite different in an,5143.28,3.28,5144.92
apartment different than in those dreary,5144.56,4.079,5146.5995
hotel rooms,5146.56,4.96,5149.04
yes you're right,5148.639,2.881,5150.0795
well it's nice to have had a look at,5151.76,4.72,5154.12
ravik you're not going yes john,5160.48,7.84,5164.4
what are you saying why this whole place,5168.32,5.919,5171.2795
should tell you why,5171.44,2.799,5172.8395
who's been talking to you telling you,5175.36,3.279,5176.9995
things morozo no one had to tell me,5176.719,3.121,5178.2795
i know because i have this apartment,5179.84,4.0,5181.84
because i don't work at the cherizzard,5182.48,2.96,5183.959999999999
any longer morozov starts to imagine,5183.84,2.96,5185.32
things and you fall right in with him,5185.44,2.56,5186.719999999999
but a person can be somebody and make,5186.8,2.0,5187.8
something out of herself that's,5188.0,1.92,5188.96
now stop your nonsense are you going to,5189.92,7.84,5193.84
beat me too,5196.4,4.48,5198.639999999999
i just wanted to stop that babbling,5197.76,4.72,5200.12
you think i'm calm just because i came,5200.88,3.2,5202.4800000000005
in here calmly,5202.48,2.719,5203.839499999999
what do you think i've been doing for,5204.08,3.599,5205.8795
the past three days i've been waiting,5205.199,3.281,5206.8395
i didn't have your telephone number i,5208.48,3.199,5210.0795
didn't think i had to know it,5209.76,4.399,5211.9595
i didn't have your address i didn't,5211.679,4.96,5214.159
think you had to know that either,5214.159,4.161,5216.2395
for three and a half months i didn't see,5216.639,3.52,5218.399
i don't think i missed you as much then,5220.159,4.0,5222.159
as when you kept away from me for one,5222.48,3.36,5224.16
my thoughts were constantly on you in my,5225.84,3.839,5227.7595
room at a hospital,5228.239,3.841,5230.1595
everywhere i sat with morozov and,5229.679,3.681,5231.5195
picture you walking in,5232.08,3.2,5233.68
you didn't come i stared at the phone,5233.36,3.2,5234.96
until i could have smashed it on the,5235.28,2.16,5236.36
but you didn't call then everything,5237.44,3.92,5239.4
became clear to me,5239.92,2.719,5241.2795
i knew you wouldn't come only i hadn't,5241.36,3.12,5242.92
wanted to believe it,5242.639,3.841,5244.5595
you had made sure of me then you could,5244.48,3.2,5246.08
afford to take your time,5246.48,3.52,5248.24
there was someone else,5250.0,5.76,5252.88
not only someone else but another life,5253.28,4.64,5255.599999999999
this life which you want me to share,5257.92,11.68,5263.76
so he'll break it off and go as simple,5266.719,4.0,5268.719
you didn't want to know anything and,5270.719,3.121,5272.2795
that loved you for it and now now you,5271.76,3.919,5273.7195
can reproach me but you wanted me anyway,5273.84,3.52,5275.6
what rights have you,5275.679,6.161,5278.7595
none i thought you had come back,5277.36,4.48,5279.599999999999

but you did not come back ravik listen,5287.12,8.72,5291.48
while you were in switzerland i waited,5296.56,6.639,5299.8795
i waited and there was nothing,5299.679,3.52,5301.439
then one day someone came,5305.12,7.92,5309.08
who wanted me nothing but me,5308.48,9.28,5313.12
holy and forever it was like a landslide,5313.04,7.52,5316.8
which one laughs said in the beginning,5317.76,3.439,5319.4795
suddenly there's nothing left to hold on,5321.199,4.48,5323.438999999999
and one can't resist any longer,5325.679,8.241,5329.7995

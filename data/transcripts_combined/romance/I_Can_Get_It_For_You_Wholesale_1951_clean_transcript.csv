exactly what I've been thinking,2238.72,4.74,2241.0899999999997
it becomes true not only for the,2241.48,4.32,2243.64
privileged and four for those who can,2243.46,3.96,2245.44
raise the capital with which to start a,2245.8,3.72,2247.6600000000003
business but for those with no more than,2247.42,4.74,2249.79
native ability and energy for all those,2249.52,5.099,2252.0695
in fact that have what is commonly known,2252.16,4.86,2254.5899999999997
as The Stuff Plus of course a little,2254.619,4.581,2256.9095
I could ask the lady with Noble to go,2262.06,4.279,2264.1995
well she'd talk to me as a matter of,2269.7,5.32,2272.3599999999997
fact she'd dance with me what do you,2272.38,4.5,2274.63
plan to do go up and pinch him,2275.02,3.599,2276.8195
that isn't done in some circles you know,2276.88,3.959,2278.8595
you have to be introduced there's a,2278.619,4.401,2280.8195
to Warsaw from Belfast and Madrid and as,2286.5,6.22,2289.61
I did myself from London to cross the,2290.68,4.32,2292.8399999999997
broad Atlantic in steerage,2292.72,5.16,2295.2999999999997
a chance to move from the side of the,2295.0,4.68,2297.34
railroad tracks on which they were born,2297.88,4.68,2300.2200000000003
to decide on which life looks and let's,2299.68,4.82,2302.0899999999997
face it is better,2302.56,4.44,2304.7799999999997
what is with Teddy where is he going,2304.5,5.56,2307.28
don't worry he'll be right back,2307.0,4.859,2309.4295
because you are all a part of the,2310.06,4.68,2312.4
promise of America's fulfillment a piece,2311.859,5.22,2314.469
of The Shining promise made by the new,2314.74,4.379,2316.9294999999997
world to the Sons and Daughters of the,2317.079,4.161,2319.1595
gets the Garment Center is more than the,2322.42,6.6,2325.7200000000003
home of an industry in which success can,2325.9,4.679,2328.2395
be achieved with no more than the,2329.02,4.02,2331.03
talents parceled out by fate of birth,2330.579,5.461,2333.3095000000003
the Government Center is also a state of,2333.04,6.18,2336.13
mind it is the Mecca to which the,2336.04,5.28,2338.68
Pilgrim's root lies,2339.22,5.399,2341.9195
not across the desert by camel Caravan,2341.32,6.6,2344.6200000000003
but across Manhattan by way of the IRT,2344.619,5.061,2347.1495
anybody can raise the fair all of you,2349.68,6.28,2352.8199999999997
have and the mecca is the Fulfillment of,2353.079,5.461,2355.8095000000003
great ambitions the success of great,2355.96,5.94,2358.93
talents reward of intelligence and,2358.54,4.62,2360.85

be so entertaining I was right to the,2499.0,3.18,2500.59
committee and apologized putting them,2500.619,3.181,2502.2095

line who wants to achieve the mecca of,2528.339,3.361,2530.0195
as it Nobles I did use that face and die,2531.7,4.26,2533.83
I can only say that I hope no one would,2534.46,3.24,2536.08
remember it I assumed you wanted,2535.96,3.24,2537.58
everyone to remember everything,2537.7,3.3,2539.35
in my position I find that the only,2539.2,3.06,2540.73
people who ever remember what I say are,2541.0,2.88,2542.44
those who want something from me well,2542.26,3.54,2544.03
what's wrong with that what you have is,2543.88,3.66,2545.71
what people should want I'm not,2545.8,4.02,2547.8100000000004
objective as a matter of fact,2547.54,4.26,2549.67
they're words that describe thoughts,2549.82,5.279,2552.4595000000004

impractical the only place a woman could,2860.319,4.981,2862.8095
wear a gown like this would be in a,2862.54,4.52,2864.8
perfume mad,2865.3,5.76,2868.1800000000003
Lorraine good afternoon Mr Noble what is,2867.06,6.519,2870.3195

him but the women know you can't sit,2873.579,3.381,2875.2695000000003
down in it,2875.44,5.12,2878.0
now what about this,2876.96,3.6,2878.76
I'd lower the neckline a bit to make it,2880.839,2.891,2882.2844999999998
more formal,2882.819,3.901,2884.7695
Oh I thought it had a certain Flair what,2890.8,4.98,2893.29
it wouldn't have on a hanger,2893.92,5.399,2896.6195000000002
the model brought her Flair with her,2895.78,8.16,2899.86
do you believe in hunches no well I do,2899.319,6.3,2902.469
I have a hunch that you and I should,2903.94,5.22,2906.55
have a serious talk and tonight oh I,2905.619,6.141,2908.6895
believe in that,2909.16,2.6,2910.46

unveiling in a minute,2914.079,4.26,2916.2090000000003
I've switched a few of your ideas around,2916.359,3.901,2918.3095
I hope you don't,2918.339,3.061,2919.8695
them to round,2921.4,4.08,2923.44
I also expect them to be improved about,2922.54,5.4,2925.24
that we'll know in a minute,2925.48,4.08,2927.52
that serves it,2929.56,3.2,2931.16

nervous why should I be,2938.02,5.22,2940.63
your work is about to be judged by if,2940.599,5.041,2943.1195000000002
you will forgive me J.F Noble,2943.24,4.44,2945.4599999999996

I'm just sure it's good,2952.0,3.859,2953.9295
but it's incomplete,2970.44,7.02,2973.9500000000003
here's how I'd like to see it finished,2973.9,3.56,2975.6800000000003
I like the way it sounds oh yes,2985.319,6.04,2988.339
yes I like it very much but you mind if,2989.26,4.14,2991.3300000000004
I speak frankly,2991.359,3.181,2992.9494999999997
you're going to say something,2993.4,2.62,2994.71
disagreeable,2994.54,2.88,2995.98
I'm going to say that if you think I'm,2999.46,3.48,3001.2
interested in you personally as a woman,3001.079,3.601,3002.8795
you're wrong,3002.94,3.419,3004.6495

such a fool always saying the wrong,4842.62,5.52,4845.38
he didn't say what he wanted to say,4858.32,4.74,4860.69
if we both love you,4860.78,6.84,4864.2
I like a father and Teddy like Teddy you,4863.06,5.52,4865.820000000001

heart in his mouth,4872.0,4.38,4874.19
we are going bankrupt,4873.86,4.44,4876.08
we're closing up even though it means,4876.38,4.859,4878.8095
the end of all our plans and hopes,4878.3,6.359,4881.4795
not because we hate you,4881.239,5.521,4883.9995
I think he's right,4884.659,4.08,4886.699
when it comes to choose between money,4886.76,4.439,4888.9795
and someone you love,4888.739,6.261,4891.8695
what choice can a man make,4891.199,3.801,4893.099499999999
uh about 15 minutes that was the,4936.219,4.48,4938.459
original one,4938.96,3.8,4940.86
thank you very much,4950.38,3.42,4952.09
there isn't any time please yay,4974.02,5.56,4976.8
Jay we've got to postpone this trip I,4979.58,5.28,4982.22
picked up Adam we've got to get off the,4983.179,3.841,4985.0995
boat we can't sail and yet you're not,4984.86,3.42,4986.57
making sense what are you talking about,4987.02,3.659,4988.8495
they won't deliver the gowns you've got,4988.28,4.08,4990.32
to go back and make them deliver,4990.679,3.181,4992.2695
you can do it through the banks through,4992.36,3.42,4994.07
the Mills you can force them to,4993.86,5.58,4996.65
but why why should I why don't you,4995.78,4.98,4998.2699999999995
understand what I'm saying they've,4999.44,3.42,5001.15
deliberately decided to go bankrupt what,5000.76,3.3,5002.41
if they think they can afford the,5002.86,3.72,5004.719999999999
gesture let them join our guests you,5004.06,4.139,5006.1295
mean you won't do anything,5006.58,6.3,5009.73
certainly not Jay you,5008.199,6.96,5011.678999999999
you've got to I can't let them go,5012.88,4.02,5014.89
any of that I will not make Mr Sherman's,5016.9,4.56,5019.179999999999
solvency the basis of our relationship,5019.0,4.26,5021.13
if you can't be happy with me in this Mr,5021.46,3.779,5023.3495
Sherman is happy too that has nothing to,5023.26,4.16,5025.34
just a minute,5028.0,3.84,5029.92
quite simply Harriet I will not lift a,5029.92,3.66,5031.75
finger to keep shavoka dresses from,5031.84,4.64,5034.16
growing down the drain,5033.58,2.9,5035.03
if you want to prevent Mr Sherman's,5042.659,4.241,5044.7795
bankruptcy all you have to do is to go,5045.159,4.02,5047.169
back to him,5046.9,5.22,5049.509999999999
go back to it yes that is the choice,5049.179,5.761,5052.0595
you'll have to make shall Biko on Nobles,5052.12,6.079,5055.1595
Teddy Sherman or me,5054.94,3.259,5056.5695
you haven't much time,5060.34,3.08,5061.88
do you want me to go back to it,5064.96,5.219,5067.5695
no Harriet I want you to stay,5068.02,5.159,5070.5995
but only if you really want to stay,5070.179,4.861,5072.6095000000005
I have no intention of spending the best,5073.179,4.201,5075.2795
years of my life playing psychoanalyst,5075.04,3.9,5076.99
or a woman who won't admit she's in love,5077.38,4.74,5079.75
with another man me in love with that,5078.94,5.58,5081.73
big baboon that loudmouth salesman with,5082.12,5.099,5084.6695
his lady byas and his cheap wisecracks,5084.52,4.86,5086.950000000001
no description is a trifle crew perhaps,5087.219,3.48,5088.959
but that's the man I mean that's,5089.38,3.42,5091.09
ridiculous I only want you to do this,5090.699,3.841,5092.6195
fortunately Harriet you want too many,5092.8,2.939,5094.2695
you wanted to get out of a 1095 dress,5095.739,4.141,5097.809499999999
house into a bright and Shining career,5098.199,3.301,5099.849499999999
I arranged that,5101.5,3.6,5103.3
now you want to luxury it in a happy,5103.3,3.359,5104.9795
conscience as well,5105.1,4.559,5107.3795
that I'm afraid cannot be arranged,5106.659,4.621,5108.969499999999
I was very happy to help you find,5109.659,3.241,5111.2795
fulfillment but I feel under no,5111.28,3.3,5112.929999999999
obligation to find fulfillment for the,5112.9,4.98,5115.389999999999
man you love I don't love it so you keep,5114.58,4.68,5116.92
of course I can understand your,5119.26,3.479,5120.9995
reluctance to crawl back on your hands,5120.699,4.321,5122.8595
and knees he'll probably insist on that,5122.739,5.041,5125.259499999999
and we must admit with some justice,5125.02,4.679,5127.3595000000005
but crawling on one's hands knees is,5127.78,3.84,5129.7
good for the soul sometimes,5129.699,3.841,5131.6195
it's a nice effect upon one's elevated,5131.62,3.42,5133.33
I know I crawled once,5135.04,4.38,5137.23
but being a victim of great pride I,5137.5,5.04,5140.02
crawled too slowly and got back too late,5139.42,4.5,5141.67
now we wouldn't want that to happen to,5142.54,2.94,5144.01
you Harriet would we,5143.92,4.739,5146.2895
so if Mr Sherman is the one you want I,5145.48,5.1,5148.03
suggest you start crawling I don't want,5148.659,4.321,5150.8195
him you're crazy,5150.58,4.619,5152.8895
well then let's leave Mr Shannon to his,5152.98,4.259,5155.1095
little bankruptcy say goodbye to our,5155.199,5.601,5157.9995
guests and start unpacking,5157.239,3.561,5159.019499999999
I'm sure you'll find your sweet most,5162.179,4.98,5164.669
attractive,5164.56,2.599,5165.8595000000005
I'm sorry jay,5181.26,3.54,5183.030000000001
I'm sorry too,5186.159,3.08,5187.699
goodbye Jay,5197.38,6.14,5200.45
I'll send you a postcard from Paris,5199.36,4.16,5201.44
what about that Ram from last season Sam,5245.38,4.799,5247.779500000001
was the full amount about fourteen,5247.3,5.6,5250.1
hundred dollars even,5250.179,2.721,5251.5395
that's enough for one night stand,5265.48,4.159,5267.559499999999
starting in the morning,5266.8,2.839,5268.2195
why noble catch you going through his,5270.88,3.359,5272.5595
pockets and have you thrown off a boat,5272.62,5.66,5275.45
no not exactly,5274.239,4.041,5276.259499999999
he told me I was in love with you,5279.219,5.101,5281.7695
that's why you wouldn't let me stay,5282.28,5.959,5285.2595
because I was in love with you we said,5284.32,3.919,5286.2795
how about you what did you say,5288.34,3.24,5289.96
me in love with that big baboon that,5291.58,5.36,5294.26
cheap sales a minute,5293.98,2.96,5295.459999999999
I forget know what I said I don't know,5297.54,4.119,5299.5995

listen to me,5305.199,4.801,5307.599499999999
maybe Seventh Avenue is a jungle but,5307.12,4.2,5309.22
that doesn't mean that you have to live,5310.0,3.3,5311.65
like a wild animal and,5311.32,5.54,5314.09
Harriet found that out so she came back,5313.3,6.0,5316.3
and remember Teddy,5316.86,5.2,5319.46
it isn't easy to walk back in after you,5319.3,7.52,5323.06
walk out it's easier to stay out,5322.06,4.76,5324.4400000000005
and Harriet,5327.28,4.439,5329.4995
it isn't easy to say,5329.32,5.18,5331.91
please come back,5331.719,7.201,5335.3195
besides falling in love is always a mess,5334.5,9.12,5339.06
what can you expect from two strangers,5338.92,4.7,5341.27
let me at least introduce you,5343.719,7.141,5347.2895
Teddy this is Harriet,5346.9,5.759,5349.7795

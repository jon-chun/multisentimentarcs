I'm glad this is not an example of,2066.7,3.179,2068.2895
British strategy,2068.56,3.42,2070.27

we're in luxury the show's still on yes,2507.94,4.98,2510.43
I've read my devotion to the dramas as,2510.16,5.48,2512.8999999999996
great as yourself,2512.92,2.72,2514.28
I suppose you want me to take these,2515.92,3.659,2517.7495
reports to come closer no no never mind,2517.3,4.38,2519.4900000000002
the war's taking up quite enough of your,2519.579,3.901,2521.5295
time this evening thank you very much,2521.68,3.919,2523.6394999999998
before the bugle blows lights out,2545.04,5.46,2547.77
we have some time to think about,2551.38,7.26,2555.01
the many traps that we have left behind,2554.68,6.38,2557.87
there's one especially I recall,2561.66,8.26,2565.79
there's one I miss the most of all we've,2565.48,7.2,2569.08
placed them on the wall just to remind,2569.92,4.28,2572.06
and I snapped my favorite Pinner as he,2574.2,8.02,2578.21
waved goodbye at the train,2578.859,9.441,2583.5795
he started to cry I yelled tonight,2582.22,10.09,2587.265
one of us has to remain,2588.3,7.1,2591.8500000000004
I'm a lonely girl I readily admitted to,2595.78,8.42,2599.9900000000002
her I was merely patriotic when I signed,2599.56,9.36,2604.24
and I'm very Frank to say I Did It for,2604.2,8.68,2608.54
the Boy and left behind,2608.92,6.899,2612.3695000000002
some men in uniform have tried to sway,2612.88,4.199,2614.9795
failed because he's always on my mind,2617.079,7.221,2620.6895
and I'm saving most of what they pay me,2620.579,7.981,2624.5695
for the boy I left behind,2624.3,9.299,2628.9495
yes he was first in line to enlist,2628.56,8.94,2633.0299999999997
chatting thee for victory,2633.599,7.601,2637.3995
they looked but found the pulse in his,2637.5,9.06,2642.03
wrist so maybe that's why they took me,2641.2,8.639,2645.5195
if they need me then I'm glad to be of,2646.56,4.48,2648.7999999999997
but there's one thing that I wish they,2651.04,4.2,2653.14
had defined,2653.44,4.86,2655.87
oh they should have told me I'd get the,2655.24,5.9,2658.1899999999996
I get eggs all over and it's getting,2674.099,6.76,2677.4790000000003
chronic I take medicine and pills of,2677.14,5.3,2679.79
every kind,2680.859,6.601,2684.1594999999998
but they'll never substitute a tonic for,2682.44,8.56,2686.7200000000003
the boy I left behind,2687.46,6.8,2690.86
the other day I got the sweetest letter,2691.0,6.66,2694.33
all my love and kisses that's the way he,2694.26,4.599,2696.5595000000003
so each night I wear his favorite,2698.859,8.0,2702.859
sweater for the boy left behind,2701.46,9.96,2706.44
he goes down to the blood bank,2706.859,8.281,2710.9995
shouting before Victory,2711.42,8.04,2715.44
he takes more blood than he gives away,2715.14,9.66,2719.97
so maybe that's why they took me,2719.46,8.74,2723.83
I'm supposed to be content and just keep,2724.8,6.16,2727.88
dreaming if if they think that I'm,2728.2,7.2,2731.7999999999997
content they must be blind cause I go to,2730.96,7.05,2734.485
sleep and wake up screaming,2735.4,13.98,2742.39
we're the victims of a thousand,2780.04,5.36,2782.72
regulations,2783.18,4.86,2785.6099999999997
that's a military,2785.4,5.58,2788.19
strategist design,2788.04,9.0,2792.54
they can't regulate a girl's Sensations,2790.98,12.22,2797.09
there's no rule that they can behind,2797.04,6.16,2800.12
I I couldn't wait until after the show,2825.599,4.801,2827.9995000000004

oh I'm sure if Miss Bruce doesn't object,4639.14,5.22,4641.75
I'm very much afraid I've taken on a,4644.36,3.359,4646.0395
difficult task,4646.58,2.76,4647.96
you'll be surprised how easy it's going,4647.719,2.52,4648.979
sit down Mr Lundy,4650.239,3.261,4651.8695
have you heard from my son in the last,4660.92,3.54,4662.6900000000005

detailed for a special mission of some,4677.9,3.72,4679.759999999999
sort that much I did learn something,4679.4,4.319,4681.559499999999
quite important I'd be important enough,4681.62,5.039,4684.1395
to take him away from his own Squadron,4683.719,5.281,4686.3595000000005
I received a trunk with books and,4686.659,4.201,4688.759499999999
personal belongings yesterday did you,4689.0,3.659,4690.8295
mean something's happened,4690.86,3.0,4692.36
no I believe that during his absence his,4693.86,3.96,4695.839999999999
Squadron is being moved to another,4696.56,3.78,4698.450000000001
station that's all,4697.82,5.3,4700.469999999999
um among the things he sent home,4707.239,4.92,4709.699
or with this Bible,4710.179,5.281,4712.8195000000005
the one I gave him when he enlisted,4712.159,6.0,4715.159
this is precisely the way it came,4715.46,5.46,4718.19
your photograph,4718.159,4.981,4720.6494999999995
the page in the theater program and see,4720.92,4.259,4723.0495
where he's written this is for her,4723.14,4.019,4725.1495
what's he trying to suggest Roslyn needs,4725.179,3.48,4726.919
quiet Judy I didn't disturb a thing here,4728.659,5.461,4731.389499999999
it is where your picture was in First,4732.26,3.6,4734.06
Corinthians,4734.12,3.539,4735.8895
the First Corinthian is one of Paul's,4735.86,4.56,4738.139999999999
Epistles the Saint Paul my Paul was,4737.659,4.201,4739.759499999999
named after him,4740.42,3.36,4742.1
I do think he's trying to tell me,4743.78,5.04,4746.3
something or or she means maybe it's um,4746.0,6.06,4749.03
you know a code or something maybe,4748.82,4.8,4751.219999999999
let's see now,4752.06,6.139,4755.1295
I'm concerned anything to her foreign,4753.62,4.579,4755.9095
what was that last one it's better to,4761.92,5.44,4764.64
marry than Mr Lonely look,4764.9,5.339,4767.5695
the words this is for her come right,4767.36,6.66,4770.69
opposite just better to marry,4770.239,6.181,4773.3295
do you suppose that that's the way I,4774.02,4.26,4776.150000000001
translated it,4776.42,4.1,4778.47
well I'll be,4778.28,8.12,4782.34
I admit it is an extraordinary way to,4786.4,4.9,4788.849999999999
propose to a girl,4789.02,3.49,4790.765
what do you think,4791.3,4.439,4793.5195
what do you think,4795.739,4.191,4797.8345
I hope you're going to accept,4797.659,5.58,4800.449
the last time I proposed was 27 years,4803.239,3.541,4805.009499999999
seem to have lost my technique,4806.78,4.86,4809.21
will you marry us rather,4809.3,4.15,4811.375
of course I will,4811.64,6.45,4814.865000000001
talk apparently over to those being,4820.94,3.96,4822.919999999999
it has every sanction I know,4824.9,3.68,4826.74
goodbye my dear,4832.34,4.44,4834.56
goodbye what I've learned about this,4834.44,4.799,4836.8395
theater tonight has made me very humble,4836.78,4.08,4838.82
and very proud,4839.239,3.361,4840.9195
it's nice to know that my daughter's a,4840.86,2.64,4842.179999999999

words the dispatch you know rarely,3375.68,4.6,3377.98
retracts a,3378.839,3.801,3380.7395
story well that's obviously because the,3380.28,5.759,3383.1595
dispatch rarely makes mistakes,3382.64,5.919,3385.5995
tomorrow however you will read the,3386.039,4.441,3388.2595
retraction of an item which appeared,3388.559,6.361,3391.7395

doubt it created as to Mr Smith's,3398.839,6.601,3402.1394999999998
Integrity Mary and I have seen a lot of,3402.96,5.2,3405.56

friend and that's a good sign,3412.559,5.24,3415.179
he's taken an interest in our civic,3415.72,4.399,3417.9195
affairs and his Devotion to the,3417.799,4.04,3419.819
basketball,3420.119,6.561,3423.3995

miracle now it took hard work at all,3429.44,6.119,3432.4995
hours and I'm sure he must have,3433.4,5.159,3435.9795
neglected his own business to do it,3435.559,6.48,3438.799
we're very lucky to acquire such a fine,3438.559,5.48,3441.299
Citizen and I thought this a good,3442.039,4.641,3444.3595
occasion to apolog oliz to him and to,3444.039,5.361,3446.7195

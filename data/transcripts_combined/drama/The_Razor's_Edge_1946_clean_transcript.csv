leave no more trace of his soen on this,408.96,5.079,411.49949999999995
Earth than a stone thrown into a river,411.199,4.761,413.5795

have an Ever growing influence over his,420.919,5.041,423.4395
fellow men so that long after his death,422.599,5.761,425.4795

cars and everybody will get richer and,763.199,5.841,766.1194999999999
richer and what's wrong with that,764.56,4.48,766.8
nothing nothing at all it it just,769.079,4.0,771.079
happens it's sitting in an office and,771.8,2.479,773.0395
making a lot of money doesn't interest,773.079,3.2,774.679
me as much as it should oh Larry don't,774.279,3.601,776.0795
talk like a fool you can't live without,776.279,3.68,778.119
money if I have a little that's what,777.88,3.88,779.82
gives me the chance to do what I want,779.959,3.641,781.7795
you're making it very difficult for me,781.76,3.439,783.4795
Larry I'm sorry darling I wouldn't if I,783.6,3.96,785.58
could help,785.199,2.361,786.3795
it you can help,789.279,4.0,791.279
yes the dead look so terribly dead when,799.56,3.639,801.3794999999999
dead what does that mean exactly just,803.199,6.161,806.2795
are you terribly unhappy darling no the,809.36,4.32,811.52
only thing that makes me unhappy is,812.36,3.08,813.9
making you,813.68,3.92,815.64
unhappy I don't think I'll ever find,815.44,5.759,818.3195000000001
peace until I make up my mind about,817.6,3.599,819.3995
things it's so difficult to put into,821.92,4.96,824.4
words the minute you try you feel,824.04,5.039,826.5595
embarrassed you say to yourself who am I,826.88,3.92,828.84
to bother my head about this that or the,829.079,3.361,830.7595
other wouldn't it be better just to,830.8,2.92,832.26
follow the beaten path and let what's,832.44,3.48,834.1800000000001
coming do you,833.72,6.16,836.8000000000001
come and then I think,835.92,5.2,838.52
of a guy I,839.88,3.6,841.68
knew a minute before he was full of life,841.12,4.92,843.58
and fun and,843.48,5.96,846.46
then he was,846.04,3.4,847.74
dead I've seen many men die but this one,852.72,6.0,855.72
different it was the last day of the war,858.72,4.679,861.0595000000001
almost the last moment he could have,860.88,4.6,863.18
saved himself but he didn't he saved me,863.399,4.281,865.5395
so he's gone and I'm here alive why it's,869.279,6.68,872.619
all so meaningless you can't help but,873.56,4.48,875.8
ask yourself what life is all about,875.959,3.24,877.579
whether there's any sense to it or,878.04,4.12,880.0999999999999
whether it's just a stupid,879.199,2.961,880.6795
blunder I hardly know what to say it's,892.8,4.88,895.24
unexpected,897.68,3.0,899.18
Larry do you think it would help if you,903.88,4.16,905.96
went away for a while I think perhaps it,905.68,5.48,908.42
would then why don't you,908.04,6.599,911.3394999999999
go because of,911.16,3.479,912.8995
you Larry let's be frank with each,917.839,5.161,920.4195000000001
other there's no place in your life for,920.759,4.721,923.1195
me just now does that mean you don't,923.0,4.6,925.3
want to be engaged to me anymore oh no,925.48,3.76,927.36
it means that I'm prepared to,929.24,3.2,930.84
wait might be a year or even,933.36,5.76,936.24
longer that doesn't,937.079,5.32,939.7389999999999
matter might be,939.12,7.0,942.62
less where have you thought of,942.399,6.721,945.7595
where well I thought I'd start by going,949.44,5.16,952.0200000000001
to Paris I went there several times on,951.48,5.159,954.0595000000001
leave I don't know why but I've got it,954.6,3.679,956.4395000000001
into my head that there everything,956.639,3.88,958.5790000000001
that's muddled in my,958.279,4.841,960.6995
mind would grow,960.519,5.76,963.399
clear it's a funny place it gives you,963.12,4.56,965.4
the feeling that you can think out your,966.279,3.521,968.0395
thoughts to the very,967.68,4.399,969.8794999999999
end I think over there I may be able to,969.8,5.08,972.3399999999999
see my way before,972.079,2.801,973.4794999999999
me and if you,975.759,6.361,978.9395000000001
don't I'll give it up as a bad job come,978.959,4.56,981.2389999999999
back to Chicago and take the first work,982.12,3.719,983.9795
get my darling,986.88,4.079,988.9195
Larry I love,990.959,6.281,994.0994999999999
you I love you so,993.199,4.041,995.2194999999999
much I cannot for the life of me,1006.399,4.201,1008.4995
understand how Isabelle could possibly,1008.8,3.719,1010.6595
prefer that young man to a fine chap,1010.6,4.4,1012.8000000000001
like gray oh I grant you he's,1012.519,4.961,1014.9995
goodlooking and his clothes fit but,1015.0,4.8,1017.4
imagine an opportunity to go in with,1017.48,4.719,1019.8395
gray and his father on the ground,1019.8,5.399,1022.4994999999999
Isabelle home so,1025.48,3.4,1027.18
yes what's the matter,1032.72,7.64,1036.54
nothing where's Larry gone hello mother,1037.12,5.199,1039.7195
did you have a talk with him yes may I,1040.36,3.679,1042.1995
been to inquire the result he's going to,1042.319,3.841,1044.2395
Europe for a while I I promised to wait,1044.039,3.52,1045.799
for him what in the world is he going to,1046.16,2.8,1047.5600000000002
do in Europe,1047.559,3.441,1049.2794999999999
loaf don't be ridiculous Isabelle that's,1048.96,3.079,1050.4995000000001
what he told me really I have no,1051.0,3.0,1052.5
patience with you if you had any Spirits,1052.039,3.161,1053.6195
you'd have broken off your engagement,1054.0,5.16,1056.58
then and there what can I do I love him,1055.2,5.479,1057.9395
along it's all,1060.679,3.441,1062.3995
right well things might be a great deal,1065.76,6.68,1069.1
worse oh thank heavens I Joseph now just,1068.16,5.879,1071.0995
say Louisa things might be a great deal,1072.44,5.599,1075.2395000000001
worse oh don't get up I don't see how my,1074.039,6.76,1077.419
poor L you have no,1078.039,4.441,1080.2595
imagination when you're young your,1080.799,3.041,1082.3195
emotions are violent but they're not,1082.48,3.6,1084.28
durable it's a delusion that absence,1083.84,3.56,1085.62
makes the heart gr,1086.08,3.32,1087.74
founder with Larry out of the way and,1087.4,3.2,1089.0
gray on the spot I don't see why,1089.4,2.519,1090.6595
Isabelle shouldn't marry him before the,1090.6,3.6,1092.3999999999999
years out you've been away from America,1091.919,4.281,1094.0595
too long Elliot you've forgotten that in,1094.2,3.64,1096.02
this country a girl doesn't marry a man,1096.2,3.8,1098.1000000000001
because her mother or even her uncle,1097.84,4.44,1100.06
wants her to that's nothing to be proud,1100.0,5.0,1102.5
of Louisa as a result of 30 years,1102.28,3.92,1104.24
experience I may tell you that a,1105.0,2.96,1106.48
marriage arranged with a proper regard,1106.2,3.32,1107.8600000000001
for position and Fortune has every,1107.96,4.36,1110.14
advantage over a love match in France,1109.52,5.08,1112.06
which after all is the only civilized,1112.32,4.2,1114.4199999999998
country in the world Isabel would Mary,1114.6,4.559,1116.8795
Gray without thinking about it twice,1116.52,4.48,1118.76
then after a few months if she was still,1119.159,3.961,1121.1395
in love with Larry that will do Elliot I,1121.0,3.52,1122.76
know what you're going to say and the,1123.12,4.12,1125.1799999999998
idea doesn't appeal to me that's one of,1124.52,4.24,1126.6399999999999
the things I've never understood about,1127.24,3.88,1129.18
you Louisa though you've lived half your,1128.76,4.279,1130.8995
life in diplomatic society and half the,1131.12,4.2,1133.2199999999998
capitals of the world you've remained,1133.039,4.441,1135.2595
hopelessly American it isn't often that,1135.32,4.359,1137.4995
you pay me a comp dear it wasn't meant,1137.48,5.12,1140.04
to be one I know well I think I'll go to,1139.679,5.521,1142.4395000000002
bed Elliot will you lock up yes dear,1142.6,5.64,1145.4199999999998
good night Mr M good,1145.2,5.479,1147.9395
night you're very full of worldly wisdom,1148.24,4.36,1150.42
this evening Elliot have you ever known,1150.679,2.841,1152.0995
be I don't mind telling you I have a,1153.52,4.76,1155.9
sneaking Sympathy for the boy he's young,1155.559,4.201,1157.6595
and he wants to sew his wi loats before,1158.28,4.04,1160.3
he settles down to married life very,1159.76,5.159,1162.3395
natural and very proper I'll keep my eye,1162.32,5.12,1164.8799999999999
on him in Paris of course he must cross,1164.919,4.441,1167.1395
on the aquatan,1167.44,3.479,1169.1795
I know the captain and he'll see that,1169.36,3.4,1171.06
Larry sits at his table and meets the,1170.919,3.12,1172.479
people I look for an apartment for him,1174.039,5.88,1176.979
in a really smart quarter I'll do him,1176.44,7.32,1180.1000000000001
proud I'll give some parties for him so,1179.919,5.921,1182.8795
many Americans when they go to Paris get,1183.76,4.12,1185.82
him with the wrong people and then they,1185.84,4.6,1188.1399999999999
find it no end of a job to shake them,1187.88,5.56,1190.66
off I'll have my chauffeur Marcel drive,1190.44,4.239,1192.5595
him about in the,1193.44,3.64,1195.26
roads I detest the,1194.679,4.721,1197.0395
countryside but but alas all Americans,1197.08,4.44,1199.3
are born tourists and no doubt he'll,1199.4,4.68,1201.74
want to see the,1201.52,4.8,1203.92
sence it would be perfect if I could,1204.08,4.36,1206.26
arrange for some older woman to take him,1206.32,6.44,1209.54
under her wing princess no Mele for,1208.44,7.4,1212.14
instance he is Young and he has a good,1212.76,6.0,1215.76
figure I think she'd fall for him like a,1215.84,5.319,1218.4995
bricks in any event the busier I keep,1223.159,4.361,1225.3395
him the less time he'll have to think,1226.0,4.159,1228.0795
about Isabel,1227.52,2.639,1228.8395
defended we met,1236.72,6.079,1239.7595000000001
Mo anything for Lawrence,1239.64,7.56,1243.42
Daryl this wiress came day before,1242.799,4.401,1244.9995
yesterday about excuse me pardon me when,1249.64,5.88,1252.5800000000002

arrive thank you B on,1255.52,4.6,1257.82
Larry I've missed you I've missed you so,1281.4,5.519,1284.1595
may I ask how he knew you were coming,1291.159,4.12,1293.219
Isabelle cabled him from the ship are,1292.96,4.839,1295.3795
they still engaged as far as I know what,1295.279,5.52,1298.039
about GRE matri still faithful I don't,1297.799,4.48,1300.039
believe you played your cards very well,1300.799,3.48,1302.539
Louisa I never had much card since,1302.279,4.201,1304.3795
Elliot mother here he is oh how good of,1304.279,3.76,1306.159
you to come Larry so nice to see you Mrs,1306.48,3.559,1308.2595000000001
Bradley hello Mr tempton how do you do,1308.039,3.361,1309.7195
Uncle Elliot May Larry come along to,1310.039,3.0,1311.539
dinner with us larious give me to,1311.4,3.04,1312.92
understand he doesn't die now oh he will,1313.039,3.161,1314.6195
tonight won't you I will that's very,1314.44,3.92,1316.4
good of you I'm sure she be delighted,1316.2,5.68,1319.04
we'll meet you at the house taxi,1318.36,7.0,1321.86
taxi come along Dad I've got a million,1321.88,5.919,1324.8395
get I'm afraid I having a very good,1341.679,3.761,1343.5595
account to give you that young man,1343.76,4.68,1346.1
Louisa oh when he first came over to,1345.44,4.88,1347.88
Paris for Isabelle's sake I asked him to,1348.44,3.359,1350.1195
lunch to meet the sort of people he,1350.32,3.64,1352.1399999999999
ought to know and he told me he didn't,1351.799,4.681,1354.1395
eat lunch perhaps he doesn't and then,1353.96,4.0,1355.96
when I asked him to dinner he said he,1356.48,3.84,1358.4
couldn't come because he had no evening,1357.96,4.76,1360.3400000000001
clothes if I live to be 100 I should,1360.32,4.2,1362.4199999999998
never understand how any young man could,1362.72,3.839,1364.6395
come to Paris without evening,1364.52,4.96,1367.0
clothes maybe he just didn't want to,1366.559,4.401,1368.7595
that's the most incredible reason for,1369.48,3.04,1371.0
refusing an invitation I've ever heard,1370.96,4.199,1373.0595
in my life and where does he live I,1372.52,4.399,1374.7195
haven't a notion Isabelle writes to him,1375.159,4.481,1377.3995000000002
in care of the American Express like a,1376.919,5.481,1379.6595000000002
traveling salesman a school teacher on,1379.64,4.88,1382.0800000000002
vacation my own belief is that he's,1382.4,3.6,1384.2
living in the Latin quarter with some,1384.52,4.399,1386.7195
bit who's no better than she ought to be,1386.0,4.4,1388.2
I'm afraid you'd have to write him off,1388.919,3.681,1390.7595000000001
as one of your failures Elliot it might,1390.4,5.279,1393.0395
surprise you to know it my dear but I've,1392.6,5.679,1395.4395
already done,1395.679,2.6,1396.979
for speak so quickly I can't understand,1414.96,3.959,1416.9395
her she's telling you that it's an old,1417.559,2.841,1418.9795
French custom everyone has to wear a,1418.919,3.041,1420.4395000000002
sprig of lilies at the valley on Mayday,1420.4,4.84,1422.8200000000002
they're a symbol of Happiness,1421.96,6.8,1425.3600000000001
Miss Mayday imagine it's being May that,1425.24,5.4,1427.94
means I've been here nearly a month now,1428.76,4.279,1430.8995
impossible it was only yesterday and I,1430.64,3.44,1432.3600000000001
still don't know a thing about what,1433.039,4.041,1435.0595
you've been doing tell me Larry you must,1434.08,4.959,1436.5594999999998
know I've been dying kind to know oh,1437.08,3.36,1438.76
nothing really very exciting I've,1439.039,3.24,1440.6589999999999
traveled around read a lot gone to,1440.44,3.56,1442.22
lectures at the sbon and so forth have,1442.279,3.041,1443.7995
you found that piece of mind you were,1444.0,3.44,1445.72
looking for no but for the first time,1445.32,3.4,1447.02
I'm beginning to see things in a clear,1447.44,3.76,1449.3200000000002
light what does that,1448.72,4.839,1451.1395
mean it's rather difficult to explain,1451.2,4.44,1453.42
and even if I try you'll only be angry,1453.559,4.281,1455.6995
with me how much longer do you think all,1455.64,5.6,1458.44
this is going to take you I don't know I,1457.84,6.719,1461.1995
don't know it's hard to,1461.24,3.319,1462.8995
and after that what are you going to do,1470.48,3.84,1472.4

wisdom if I ever acquire wisdom I,1474.32,3.64,1476.1399999999999

to do with,1477.96,6.56,1481.24
it you know what Uncle Elliot,1484.52,5.639,1487.3395

"don't want to live on $3,000 a year I",1590.64,6.639,1593.9595000000002
never have and I don't see why I,1593.88,3.399,1595.5795
should we could go down to Capri for our,1600.6,3.76,1602.48
honeymoon and then in the fall we could,1602.799,2.921,1604.2595
Greece remember how we used to talk,1605.72,3.48,1607.46
about traveling all over the world,1607.64,4.039,1609.6595000000002
together of course I want to,1609.2,5.56,1611.98
travel but not like that cheap,1611.679,4.921,1614.1395
restaurants third rate,1614.76,3.36,1616.44
besides I want to have babies Larry all,1618.12,4.88,1620.56
right darling we'll take them along with,1621.679,4.161,1623.7595000000001
us oh Larry you're so impractical you,1623.0,4.84,1625.42
don't know what you're asking me to do,1625.84,4.839,1628.2595
I'm young I want to have fun do all the,1627.84,4.92,1630.3
things people do we wouldn't have a,1630.679,5.401,1633.3795
friend in the world oh Isabelle stop,1632.76,5.159,1635.3395
exaggerating we'll do everything that,1636.08,3.479,1637.8194999999998
you want to do and we'll do it together,1637.919,3.64,1639.739
oh listen darling if you hadn't as sent,1639.559,3.321,1641.2195
to your name and got a job that brought,1641.559,3.441,1643.2794999999999
"you 3,000 a year I'd marry you without a",1642.88,3.279,1644.5195
hesitation I'd could look for you I'd,1646.159,5.921,1649.1195
make beds I wouldn't care what I wore I,1648.84,4.64,1651.1599999999999
I'd think it was fun because I don't it,1652.08,2.959,1653.5594999999998
was only a question of time until you'd,1653.48,3.6,1655.28
make good but this means living like,1655.039,3.801,1656.9395
this all our lives with nothing to look,1657.08,4.68,1659.4199999999998
forward to it's asking too,1658.84,6.0,1661.84
much oh Larry you've had your fling now,1661.76,4.68,1664.1
for your own sake I beg of you to come,1664.84,3.76,1666.72
home with us but I wouldn't make you,1666.44,4.959,1668.9195
happy if I did you see what you forget,1668.6,5.28,1671.24
is that I want to learn as passionately,1671.399,4.88,1673.839
as well as gray for example wants to,1673.88,5.639,1676.6995000000002
make a lot of money,1676.279,3.24,1677.899
I came over here because I was restless,1683.96,4.4,1686.16
and because my mind was,1686.24,4.24,1688.36
muddled I came looking for the answers,1688.36,4.96,1690.84
to a lot of questions some of them I,1690.48,5.72,1693.34
found others I may never find but I,1693.32,4.719,1695.6795
can't stop,1696.2,4.359,1698.3795
now oh I know it sounds vague and,1698.039,5.721,1700.8995
trivial compared with but compared with,1700.559,4.881,1702.9995
everything that's happening at home,1703.76,4.639,1706.0795
today and I know I'm being very very,1705.44,5.64,1708.26
difficult but I can't stop now Isabelle,1708.399,4.76,1710.779
I just can't but what would happen to,1711.08,3.839,1712.9995
America if everyone did as you're doing,1713.159,3.0,1714.659
but the answer to that is that everyone,1714.919,3.88,1716.8590000000002
doesn't feel as I do fortunately for,1716.159,4.0,1718.159
themselves most people are just content,1718.799,2.72,1720.1589999999999
to follow the normal course and take,1720.159,2.681,1721.4995000000001
things as they,1721.519,5.481,1724.2595000000001
are oh I wish I could too but I know if,1722.84,5.8,1725.74
I tried I'd just make a mess of your,1727.0,4.399,1729.1995
life and of mine,1728.64,2.759,1730.0195
but what's this all going to lead,1733.519,5.241,1736.1395
know it may be that when I'm through I,1740.559,3.761,1742.4395
will have found something to give that,1742.919,3.041,1744.4395000000002
people will be glad to,1744.32,4.839,1746.7395
take it's just a chance but even if I,1745.96,4.92,1748.42
fail I sh be any worse off than a fellow,1749.159,2.961,1750.6395
who's gone into business and hasn't made,1750.88,3.679,1752.7195000000002
it then there's nothing more to be,1757.84,4.04,1759.86
said here you,1763.279,4.621,1765.5895
Isabelle we this on another finger,1773.679,7.12,1777.239
please we're still friends of,1776.399,6.921,1779.8594999999998
course shall we,1780.799,5.641,1783.6195
well go on go,1803.96,2.839,1805.3795
on I don't believe it Louisa dear do you,1806.919,4.921,1809.3795
realize that in the two months you've,1810.44,4.359,1812.6195
been here I haven't won a,1811.84,2.959,1813.3194999999998
game who's winning I am,1822.24,7.0,1825.74
well I must say Isabelle is taking it,1830.519,3.88,1832.459
very well she told you exactly what,1831.96,3.92,1833.92
happened only that she and Larry talked,1834.399,2.601,1835.6995
it over and came to the conclusion,1835.88,3.039,1837.3995000000002
they'd made a mistake has she written to,1837.0,3.48,1838.74
gray I wouldn't know I am not in the,1838.919,4.081,1840.9595000000002
habit of opening her mail if you ask me,1840.48,3.84,1842.4
she's very well out of it of course,1843.0,2.679,1844.3395
there's no doubt there was a strong,1844.32,4.44,1846.54
physical attraction but that's,1845.679,3.081,1847.2195000000002
all good night mother Good night darling,1848.919,3.561,1850.6995000000002

catch the boat train in the morning well,1852.48,5.4,1855.18
you're very dressed up you seem to be,1855.0,5.6,1857.8
going somewhere yes where oh nowhere in,1857.88,4.6,1860.18
particular Larry and I are going out on,1860.6,3.079,1862.1395
Larry we thought we'd like to spend our,1863.679,5.0,1866.179
last night together evening I trust you,1865.72,5.919,1868.6795
mean I'm profoundly shocked if he had,1868.679,4.281,1870.8195
any sense of decency he' never have,1871.639,4.64,1873.9589999999998
asked you but he didn't ask me I asked,1872.96,5.48,1875.7
him you should forbid her to go Louisa,1876.279,3.801,1878.1795
will you pay any attention to me if I do,1878.44,3.92,1880.4
Isabelle no darling none in that case I,1880.08,3.36,1881.76
don't think there's any point in my,1882.36,3.48,1884.1
pretty dress you had,1893.12,6.439,1896.3394999999998
on I hadn't realized it was cut quite so,1894.679,4.88,1897.1190000000001
I've never seen you so,1927.799,8.911,1932.2545
foreign speech,1956.679,6.441,1959.8995
speech fore,1958.96,4.16,1961.04
that was a brilliant performance my,2381.92,5.6,2384.7200000000003
dear I left the door just a little,2383.64,7.439,2387.3595
open should I get you a drink I expect,2387.52,5.88,2390.46
it you think you're very clever don't,2395.4,8.08,2399.44
you I don't think it I know,2399.4,6.439,2402.6195000000002
it come come child be,2403.48,4.68,2405.82
reasonable I guessed you were up to,2405.839,4.681,2408.1794999999997
something even your poor mother noticed,2408.16,4.0,2410.16
the pains you went to to make yourself a,2410.52,2.96,2412.0
tonight you're,2413.48,6.56,2416.76
hateful but no fool my,2416.24,3.8,2418.14
angel am I right in surmising that you,2420.52,3.559,2422.2995
thought if you could get him to come,2422.92,3.88,2424.86
back here it was almost inevitable that,2424.079,5.881,2427.0195000000003
the inevitable should,2426.8,3.16,2428.38
happen no one could put it more,2433.119,4.161,2435.1995
delicately we know what the consequences,2438.119,4.321,2440.2795
may be when a poor girl Strays from the,2440.359,5.96,2443.339
narrow path of virtue do we my guess is,2442.44,5.44,2445.16
that if your unscrupulous Clan had come,2446.319,3.76,2448.199
off it wouldn't have been long after you,2447.88,3.52,2449.6400000000003
returned to Chicago before The Wretched,2450.079,3.201,2451.6795

woman of you you can be wonderfully,2455.2,4.28,2457.3399999999997
disagreeable when you like Uncle Elliot,2457.68,5.439,2460.3995

gifts why didn't you go through with,2463.44,5.96,2466.42
this when I looked into his eyes and saw,2466.88,4.28,2469.02

trap for him I couldn't bring myself to,2471.16,3.679,2472.9995
play such a dirty,2473.56,5.039,2476.0795
trick I couldn't help,2474.839,6.681,2478.1794999999997

I like to keep my hand in what are you,2816.72,4.92,2819.18
going to do when you get enough of this,2819.0,4.48,2821.24

about the answers to all those profound,2834.599,5.24,2837.219
questions you have been asking yourself,2837.16,4.52,2839.42
don't you know people have been asking,2839.839,4.881,2842.2795
the same questions for thousands of,2841.68,4.679,2844.0195
yes but doesn't the fact that people,2846.359,3.161,2847.9395
have been asking those same questions,2847.599,3.48,2849.339
for thousands of years only go to prove,2849.52,4.28,2851.66
that they can't help asking them very,2851.079,6.321,2854.2395
good very good you're not altogether,2853.8,5.759,2856.6795
stupid as a matter of fact you sound,2857.4,4.12,2859.46
like a very religious man who doesn't,2859.559,4.641,2861.8795
believe in,2861.52,2.68,2862.86
God I'm not sure that I believe in,2864.4,6.04,2867.42
anything have you ever thought of going,2868.44,3.0,2869.94
no India for instance,2873.24,8.68,2877.58
I went there I met a strange man a man I,2877.559,7.401,2881.2595
never thought to meet in this world a,2881.92,5.72,2884.78
saint people go from all parts of India,2884.96,5.52,2887.7200000000003
to see him tell him their troubles ask,2887.64,5.84,2890.56
his advice and listen to his teaching,2890.48,5.32,2893.14
and they go away strengthened in Soul,2893.48,6.0,2896.48
and peace but it's not his teaching that,2895.8,7.279,2899.4395000000004
so remarkable the man himself did he,2899.48,5.16,2902.06
but that wasn't his fault it was,2906.28,4.36,2908.46
mine how did you ever come to go to,2911.0,6.64,2914.32
India to escape my pursuer he followed,2914.72,6.0,2917.72
me there I have wallowed in the gutters,2917.64,5.64,2920.46
of half the seaports of Europe to put,2920.72,5.56,2923.5
him off my track he was waiting for,2923.28,6.92,2926.7400000000002
me I know however far I flee one day he,2926.28,5.92,2929.2400000000002
will come up with me and I shall feel,2930.2,4.04,2932.22
the terrible,2932.2,4.72,2934.56
hand on my my,2934.24,4.64,2936.56
shoulder wouldn't it be better to face,2936.92,3.52,2938.6800000000003
the issue and take your punishment but,2938.88,3.719,2940.7395
you don't know what the punishment is,2940.44,4.159,2942.5195
it's not the prisoner The Hangman's rope,2942.599,5.321,2945.2595
I could face that it's,2944.599,4.881,2947.0395000000003
forgiveness,2949.48,5.52,2952.2400000000002
love didn't anybody ever tell you that,2952.119,7.361,2955.7995
I'm a unfrocked,2955.0,4.48,2957.24
priest it's not the police I'm running,2960.799,3.721,2962.6594999999998
I'd kill anyone who tried to arrest,2966.319,4.52,2968.579
God get out you fool I'm going to get,2983.48,5.599,2986.2795
sorry we were interrupted they're,3072.119,5.801,3075.0195000000003
pilgrims they come from many places some,3074.4,6.56,3077.6800000000003
from quite far,3077.92,3.04,3079.44
distances what has brought you here my,3082.799,4.121,3084.8595
I've come to,3086.92,4.36,3089.1
learn ever since the war I've been,3089.079,4.121,3091.1395
searching for,3091.28,4.24,3093.4
something something that I I've have not,3093.2,4.68,3095.54
been able to put into,3095.52,4.599,3097.8195
words I've been told that from you I,3097.88,4.719,3100.2395
might find,3100.119,4.96,3102.599
guidance God is the only,3102.599,5.601,3105.3995
guide but perhaps if we talk he may show,3105.079,6.361,3108.2595
me a way to help you to my friends I'm a,3108.2,5.68,3111.04
loafer afraid of,3111.44,4.2,3113.54
responsibilities I can't even even make,3113.88,3.719,3115.7395
those I love understand what I'm,3115.64,4.159,3117.7194999999997
after the very fact that you've taken,3117.599,3.801,3119.4995000000004
the time to come this great distance in,3119.799,3.601,3121.5995
search of knowledge proves that you're,3121.4,3.679,3123.2395
not afraid of,3123.4,3.56,3125.1800000000003
responsibilities even to admit that you,3125.079,6.72,3128.4390000000003
want to learn is in itself,3126.96,4.839,3129.3795
courageous I've studied I've traveled,3132.68,4.08,3134.72
I've read everything I could get my,3135.4,4.8,3137.8
hands on and nothing seems to satisfy,3136.76,6.12,3139.82
me like everyone else I want to succeed,3140.2,5.56,3142.98
I want to improve but not NE necessarily,3142.88,5.919,3145.8395
in the terms of what the world calls,3145.76,5.839,3148.6795
success somehow I've lost confidence in,3148.799,4.921,3151.2595
the accepted,3151.599,4.321,3153.7595
values I try to get excited at the,3153.72,4.0,3155.72
prospect of settling down minding my own,3155.92,4.56,3158.2000000000003
business and making good but it only,3157.72,6.24,3160.8399999999997
increases my urge to move,3160.48,3.48,3162.22
on I know that if I do find what I'm,3164.44,5.159,3167.0195
looking for it will be something that I,3167.079,4.0,3169.079
can share with,3169.599,6.321,3172.7595
others but how to find it and where all,3171.079,6.961,3174.5595000000003
your restlessness and confusion are not,3175.92,4.24,3178.04
unique my son the whole world is,3178.04,5.36,3180.72
restless and Confused it will always be,3180.16,6.36,3183.3399999999997
so as long as men set their ideals on,3183.4,4.76,3185.78
objects there can be no real happiness,3188.16,5.36,3190.8399999999997
until men learn that it comes from,3191.599,4.441,3193.8195
themselves I,3196.28,5.319,3198.9395000000004
know it is written that the wise man,3198.24,5.04,3200.7599999999998
lives from within,3201.599,4.561,3203.8795
himself which is from God,3203.28,5.64,3206.1000000000004
from within his own heart this is the,3206.16,4.04,3208.18
forbearance,3211.88,4.64,3214.2000000000003
compassion,3213.52,3.0,3215.02
selflessness and everlasting,3217.319,4.28,3219.459
peace that's not easy,3222.079,6.361,3225.2595
no the road to Salvation is difficult to,3225.64,6.76,3229.02
pass over as difficult as the sharp edge,3228.44,5.2,3231.04
razor but this much which we know and,3233.64,4.88,3236.08
all religions teach,3236.839,5.0,3239.339
it there is in every one of us a spark,3238.52,5.559,3241.2995
of the infinite goodness which created,3241.839,4.681,3244.1794999999997
us and when we leave this earth we are,3244.079,5.52,3246.8390000000004
reunited with it as a raindrop falling,3246.52,6.0,3249.52
from Heaven is at last reunited with the,3249.599,6.081,3252.6395
sea which gave it,3252.52,3.16,3254.1
may I stay here with you of course you,3266.359,6.401,3269.5595
may our life's very simple there are,3269.319,7.121,3272.8795
books we will talk together you can even,3272.76,6.92,3276.2200000000003
work in the fields if you,3276.44,3.24,3278.06
wish we Indians,3280.76,4.599,3283.0595000000003
believe there are three roads that lead,3283.04,5.4,3285.74
to God one is the path of faith and,3285.359,5.48,3288.0989999999997
worship what is the path of good works,3288.44,5.159,3291.0195
performed for the love of God and then,3290.839,5.28,3293.479
there is a third path which leads,3293.599,4.921,3296.0595000000003
through knowledge to,3296.119,4.96,3298.599
wisdom you have chosen the way of,3298.52,5.079,3301.0595
knowledge but you'll find in the end my,3301.079,5.391,3303.7745
son but the three paths are but one,3303.599,9.791,3308.4945000000002
path one of my students will show you,3315.68,3.16,3317.2599999999998

I'm afraid that was not a great success,5297.96,5.48,5300.7
some Shock to see Sophie boy was she,5300.36,6.359,5303.5395
tight if not worse that's funny I got,5303.44,5.48,5306.179999999999
the same impression do you remember her,5306.719,5.0,5309.219
at all very well I liked her I remember,5308.92,5.64,5311.74
her husband you never saw two people so,5311.719,4.561,5313.9995
crazy about each other they got to be a,5314.56,4.0,5316.56
regular joke around Chicago but what,5316.28,5.359,5318.9595
happened didn't you,5318.56,3.079,5320.0995
know Bob and the baby were,5321.8,6.48,5325.04
killed a car hit,5324.56,3.72,5326.42
them oh so that's what it is she nearly,5331.0,5.44,5333.72
went crazy we did all we could to help,5334.4,3.799,5336.2995
her but it was no good if you asked her,5336.44,3.279,5338.0795
to dinner she'd come in plastered and,5338.199,3.601,5339.9995
pass out before the evening was over,5339.719,3.761,5341.5995
last we simply had to drop her she,5341.8,3.28,5343.4400000000005
became impossible of course it was a,5343.48,3.84,5345.4
shock and I was terribly sorry for her,5345.08,4.36,5347.26
but a normal person recovers if she went,5347.32,3.68,5349.16
to Pieces it was because she was always,5349.44,3.52,5351.2
unbalanced even her love for Bob was,5351.0,4.199,5353.0995
exaggerated aren't I right,5352.96,4.679,5355.2995
Larry no I don't agree with you,5355.199,4.96,5357.678999999999
Isabelle she was as normal as any person,5357.639,5.0,5360.139
I've ever known,5360.159,4.681,5362.4995
I remember any you were better than you,5362.639,5.361,5365.3195000000005
did was she in love with you good,5364.84,7.44,5368.56
Heavens no she was only a kid just a,5368.0,7.159,5371.5795
skinny little girl with a bow in her,5372.28,6.2,5375.38
hair I remember her crying once when,5375.159,6.04,5378.179
when I was reading an ode of,5378.48,4.96,5380.959999999999
Keats because it was so,5381.199,6.48,5384.438999999999
beautiful girls of that age are very,5383.44,4.239,5385.559499999999
emotional oh there was a lot to her in,5388.239,5.681,5391.0795
those days,5390.36,3.56,5392.139999999999

a woman like that how did you sacrifice,5704.4,7.44,5708.12
S I gave up Larry for one reason only,5708.199,5.321,5710.8595

because the sight of you always gives me,5746.119,3.52,5747.879
have you ever been told that your nose,5754.84,3.2,5756.4400000000005
is exactly like that of the psyche in,5756.239,4.241,5758.3595
the museum of Naples and that's the,5758.04,4.48,5760.28
loveliest representation of virginal,5760.48,3.759,5762.3595
beauty that ever,5762.52,4.199,5764.619500000001

shapely I can't cease to be surprised at,5768.04,4.04,5770.06
them because they were thick and lumpy,5770.28,3.52,5772.04
when I first saw you I can't imagine how,5772.08,5.96,5775.0599999999995
you've managed it an iron,5773.8,4.24,5775.92
will but of course your Most Fascinating,5779.8,5.28,5782.4400000000005

hands they're so slim and elegant I was,5785.08,3.92,5787.04
under the impression you thought them,5787.8,4.52,5790.06
too big not for your height and,5789.0,5.719,5791.8595
build I'm always amazed at the infinite,5792.32,5.76,5795.2
grace with which you use them huh,5794.719,6.081,5797.7595
whether by nature or by Art you never,5798.08,4.28,5800.22
make a gesture Without imparting Beauty,5800.8,2.399,5801.9995
it they're like flowers sometimes and,5803.199,5.761,5806.0795
sometimes like birds on the,5807.199,4.081,5809.2395
wing there are moments when I don't puzz,5808.96,5.36,5811.64
positively dislike you in fact sometimes,5811.28,5.2,5813.88
I think you're rather sweet I will not,5814.32,3.919,5816.2795
have my face smeared with,5816.48,3.759,5818.3595
lipstick if you want to kiss me kiss me,5818.239,3.48,5819.978999999999
on the lips which is what a merciful,5820.239,4.44,5822.459

that was the very last I saw or heard of,6913.639,4.321,6915.7995
s McDonald for almost a,6915.36,4.96,6917.839999999999
year as a matter of record is the very,6917.96,4.719,6920.3195
last any of us knew of,6920.32,4.759,6922.6995
her I settled down at my Cottage on the,6922.679,4.881,6925.1195
Riviera near cap farar to finish my,6925.079,5.6,6927.879
book and then one day the police of ton,6927.56,5.519,6930.3195000000005
miss good morning m m,6946.84,7.48,6950.58
I see M the I have that distinction I,6950.119,5.881,6953.059499999999
must apologize for being obliged to,6954.32,3.64,6956.139999999999
inconvenience a person of your,6956.0,3.8,6957.9
distinction I sure sure nothing can make,6957.96,4.4,6960.16
me happier than being service to you now,6959.8,4.279,6961.9395
this yes this is a very dirty business,6964.079,5.16,6966.659
mure it appears that the woman sopi,6967.159,5.56,6969.938999999999
McDonald had a very evil reputation she,6969.239,5.201,6971.839499999999
was brutally,6972.719,3.601,6974.5195
what her body was fished out of the,6976.32,5.879,6979.2595
Arbor the throat was cut from ear to,6978.719,6.48,6981.959
Dreadful how does it happen that a,6988.96,4.279,6991.0995
person of your,6991.88,4.44,6994.1
age and respectability should be,6993.239,5.041,6995.759499999999
acquainted with such a character I knew,6996.32,4.56,6998.599999999999
very slightly this volume was found in,6998.28,4.399,7000.4794999999995
her room if you will examine the,7000.88,5.08,7003.42
autograph page you will see T suggest,7002.679,4.801,7005.0795
that your acquaintance with her was as,7005.96,5.52,7008.72
slight as you claim,7007.48,4.0,7009.48
Al nice sweet let us see if the,7012.32,5.839,7015.2395
rose if you're suggesting I was her,7016.079,3.921,7018.0395
lover you're mistaken it would be no,7018.159,3.48,7019.898999999999
Affair of mine and without wishing to,7020.0,4.48,7022.24
say anything offensive to you I must add,7021.639,5.56,7024.419

factory or a,7992.199,3.561,7993.9794999999995
garage I've always liked machinery and,7993.44,3.759,7995.3195
besides when I'm washing a car or,7995.76,4.04,7997.780000000001
tinkering with a car Ator my mind's free,7997.199,3.641,7999.019499999999
and at the same time I feel I'm,7999.8,3.96,8001.78
accomplishing something and after,8000.84,6.16,8003.92
that I don't know I uh I might buy a,8003.76,6.72,8007.12
taxi a taxi why not it's a good life,8007.0,4.8,8009.4
you're always on the go you meet a lot,8010.48,3.759,8012.3595
of different people oh Larry for heaven,8011.8,5.2,8014.400000000001
sake what you need is a good,8014.239,4.521,8016.4995
psychiatrist sometimes I think you're,8017.0,4.28,8019.14
completely out of your mind just look,8018.76,5.68,8021.6
what you've done with your life and with,8021.28,5.2,8023.88
mine what in Heaven's name are you,8024.44,5.52,8027.2
trying to prove,8026.48,3.48,8028.219999999999
I'd hope you'd come back to the states,8038.599,3.56,8040.379
with us Gray's going into business again,8039.88,4.64,8042.2
and he'll need all the help he can get,8042.159,3.92,8044.119
Larry you've no idea what you've done,8044.52,3.719,8046.3795
for him he spoke of it again only,8046.079,4.64,8048.398999999999
yesterday you can't see the change but I,8048.239,5.041,8050.759499999999
can when you're around he's different,8050.719,4.801,8053.1195
much like his old self gray is all right,8053.28,5.52,8056.04
he doesn't need me but suppose he does,8055.52,4.679,8057.8595000000005
suppose something goes wrong again and,8058.8,3.399,8060.4995
he has another breakdown you can't,8060.199,3.281,8061.8395
imagine what he went through the last,8062.199,2.88,8063.638999999999
time it wasn't just a matter of,8063.48,5.079,8066.019499999999
headaches or nerves he was sick really,8065.079,5.6,8067.879
sick Larry I've never told this to,8068.559,4.241,8070.6795
anyone before but for months and months,8070.679,4.201,8072.7795
we had to watch him every minute it,8072.8,3.52,8074.56
wasn't just losing his money and the,8074.88,3.719,8076.7395
business his father had built up it was,8076.32,4.879,8078.7595
more than that he blamed himself for all,8078.599,3.801,8080.4995
the things that happened to those little,8081.199,3.281,8082.8395
people who trusted him with their,8082.4,5.64,8085.219999999999
savings I honestly believe if it hadn't,8084.48,7.04,8088.0
for the children he'd have killed,8088.04,5.639,8090.8595
himself there's nothing so surprising,8091.52,3.96,8093.5
about that,8093.679,4.0,8095.679
Isabelle I don't suppose there's a man,8095.48,4.079,8097.519499999999
or woman living today who hasn't felt,8097.679,4.48,8099.919
that way at least once in their lives,8099.559,4.721,8101.9195
the wonderful thing about life is that,8102.159,4.0,8104.159
most of us get a second,8104.28,4.399,8106.4794999999995
chance I got a second,8106.159,4.361,8108.3395
chance right at the moment when I,8108.679,2.96,8110.159
thought there was nothing in the world,8110.52,3.96,8112.5
worthwhile living,8111.639,2.841,8113.0595
for do you know what it means to see an,8115.559,5.321,8118.2195
another man give up his life for you do,8117.88,5.12,8120.4400000000005
you have you ever thought what it is to,8120.88,3.48,8122.62
walk the streets at night knowing that,8123.0,3.199,8124.5995
you're walking in another man's,8124.36,5.56,8127.139999999999
shoes that someone deliberately died so,8126.199,5.121,8128.759499999999
that you might go on,8129.92,3.44,8131.64
listen do you remember that night in,8133.36,4.0,8135.36
Chicago when we talked at the Country,8135.4,4.04,8137.42
Club I told you then that I didn't think,8137.36,3.6,8139.16
I'd ever find,8139.44,5.159,8142.019499999999
myself well I haven't yet,8140.96,5.56,8143.74
completely I found some of the things,8144.599,4.0,8146.599
that I was looking for and someday I may,8146.52,3.8,8148.42
find them all but in any event I'm going,8148.599,3.801,8150.4995
to keep right on,8150.32,4.96,8152.799999999999
looking it isn't easy and it isn't,8152.4,5.56,8155.179999999999
fun I've known moments of futility and,8155.28,5.48,8158.0199999999995
frustration,8157.96,2.8,8159.36
I but that's all passed now past and,8161.48,6.88,8164.919999999999
done I know what lies ahead I know where,8164.8,6.12,8167.860000000001
I'm going and Gray in his own way can do,8168.36,4.04,8170.38
the same thing because this is his,8170.92,5.759,8173.7995
second chance and I know he'll come,8172.4,4.279,8174.5395
through all right suppose he does and,8176.719,4.48,8178.959
what about,8179.88,3.96,8181.86
me doesn't it mean anything to you that,8181.199,4.841,8183.6195
I love you that I've never loved anybody,8183.84,4.48,8186.08
else but you that my children might have,8186.04,5.24,8188.66
been your children that oh why didn't I,8188.32,5.239,8190.9394999999995
marry you when I had the chance I could,8191.28,4.359,8193.459499999999
have you know I could have that last,8193.559,3.561,8195.3395
night in Paris you were ready enough to,8195.639,3.641,8197.459499999999
give up all this foolishness for me if I,8197.12,3.399,8198.819500000001
just had brains enough I could have,8199.28,3.439,8200.9995
saved you but no I threw you out I,8200.519,5.601,8203.3195
thought I was being so Noble,8202.719,3.401,8204.4195
remember look at me,8206.679,4.92,8209.139
Larry you know you love,8208.679,6.0,8211.679
me you know that you've always wanted,8211.599,8.241,8215.719500000001
me say it's true say you know it's,8214.679,11.161,8220.2595
true oh Larry I love you I love,8219.84,9.599,8224.6395
you promise you'll come back with us,8225.84,6.16,8228.92
promise you,8229.439,2.561,8230.719500000001
tell me about Sophie,8244.399,3.0,8245.899
Sophie what about,8254.24,4.279,8256.3795
Sophie that afternoon she came to your,8256.439,3.88,8258.379
apartment did she have anything to,8258.519,4.241,8260.639500000001
yeska how did you,8262.76,3.48,8264.5
know isn't it strange that she should,8266.599,5.601,8269.3995
have asked for such an unfamiliar,8269.0,3.2,8270.6
lur she didn't ask for anything she just,8273.88,4.719,8276.2395
helped herself I had to leave to pick up,8276.439,4.04,8278.459
my daughter at the dentist's and when I,8278.599,3.481,8280.3395
returned Sophie was gone and the bottle,8280.479,2.721,8281.8395
empty when you found Sophie gone and the,8283.2,4.88,8285.640000000001
bottle empty weren't you surprised I,8285.479,4.281,8287.619499999999
thought she got tired of waiting when I,8288.08,3.16,8289.66
noticed the bottle was empty I thought,8289.76,3.52,8291.52
the Butler had drunk it I very nearly,8291.24,4.84,8293.66
spoke to him about,8293.28,2.8,8294.68
you never were a very good liar,8298.92,4.479,8301.1595
isabo you don't believe,8300.84,4.879,8303.2795
me not for a,8303.399,5.561,8306.1795
moment then,8305.719,3.241,8307.3395
don't all right if you want the truth,8315.0,3.479,8316.7395
you can have it I did it and I do it,8316.88,3.2,8318.48
again I was determined to stop at,8318.479,2.801,8319.8795
nothing to prevent her marrying you,8320.08,2.68,8321.42
nobody else would do a thing they didn't,8321.28,4.039,8323.299500000001
care I did oh Larry you men are such,8322.76,4.52,8325.02
fools I knew that sooner or later she'd,8325.319,3.561,8327.0995
break down and stuck out a,8327.28,4.0,8329.28
mile you saw how jittery she was at the,8328.88,4.32,8331.039999999999
Ritz I knew she'd give her soul for a,8331.28,4.279,8333.4195
drink the idea came to me when Uncle,8333.2,4.56,8335.480000000001
Elliott made such a fuss about the stuff,8335.559,5.681,8338.3995
I hated it but I pretended it was,8337.76,3.48,8339.5
wonderful I knew if she had a chance,8344.399,4.641,8346.7195
she'd never,8346.519,2.521,8347.7795
resist that's why I offered to give her,8349.92,3.799,8351.8195
a wedding dress I made up my mind that,8351.8,3.28,8353.439999999999
if I found Sophie had not touched the,8353.719,3.121,8355.279499999999
bottle I'd make the best of things and,8355.08,4.399,8357.2795
try to be friends with it that's true I,8356.84,4.08,8358.880000000001
it when I came back and saw the bottle,8360.92,5.96,8363.9
was empty I knew I'd been right all,8364.08,6.399,8367.2795
alone that's pretty much what I,8366.88,7.16,8370.46
thought Sophie's,8370.479,3.561,8372.2595
dead her body was was found in the,8385.96,6.359,8389.1395
harbor at tul long she'd been,8387.96,4.359,8390.1395
murdered oh how,8392.64,6.88,8396.08
horrible do they know who did,8395.84,6.4,8399.04
do there's no need to be shocked about,8409.96,3.92,8411.919999999998
Sophie any longer,8412.2,3.76,8414.08
Isabelle I've had the feeling all day,8413.88,3.28,8415.519999999999
that Sophie is where she would want to,8415.96,2.84,8417.38
most Bob and,8418.8,5.2,8421.4
Linda oh I know it's a very usual and,8421.76,4.76,8424.14
simple way to look at it,8424.0,5.76,8426.88
comforting goodbye,8432.96,5.04,8435.48
Isabelle and take good care of,8435.16,6.96,8438.64
gray he needs you now more than,8438.0,4.12,8440.06
he's gone I,8480.359,3.761,8482.2395
know I've lost,8490.04,3.64,8491.86
him lost him for good and I love him I,8496.64,8.52,8500.9
love him so tenderly now I've lost,8501.08,6.88,8504.52
him do you suppose we'll ever see him,8505.16,6.4,8508.36
again it isn't likely his America will,8507.96,5.359,8510.6395
be as remote from yours,8511.56,6.24,8514.68
as the goby desert it's all so crazy so,8513.319,6.961,8516.7995
useless what is he trying to do with his,8517.8,5.84,8520.72
life what does he hope to find my dear,8520.28,4.96,8522.76
Larry has found what we all want and,8523.64,3.92,8525.599999999999
very few of us ever,8525.24,4.92,8527.699999999999
get I don't think anyone can fail to be,8527.56,4.32,8529.72
better than,8530.16,5.64,8532.98
nobler Kinder for know,8531.88,6.8,8535.279999999999

force in the,8542.12,5.46,8544.85
world and he's got,8544.359,21.801,8555.2595

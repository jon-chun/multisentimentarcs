you look very pretty in her bed Jackie,421.44,4.099,423.4895

bit it'll be wearing one of the next two,427.5,3.78,429.39
or three weeks but you know I can,429.0,4.8,431.4
I know you can and I know you will,431.28,4.8,433.67999999999995
or I'll tell your boyfriend and Bill,433.8,3.42,435.51
will keep you in bed for the rest of,436.08,2.22,437.19
your life if I tell them that it's,437.22,2.699,438.5695
now look here Julie we've been over this,439.919,6.18,443.00899999999996
before you've got to slow down I promise,442.38,5.7,445.23
oh you promised before would you go,446.099,4.021,448.10949999999997
right on the same way,448.08,4.559,450.35949999999997
your writing takes too much out of you,450.12,4.859,452.5495
what you put in it,452.639,4.261,454.7695
then in addition you'll take all bills,454.979,4.22,457.089
troubles on your shoulders too,456.9,6.12,459.96
staging casting every last detail of,459.199,5.861,462.1295
production but we've always worked that,463.02,4.86,465.45
way he wouldn't understand it if I he'll,465.06,6.18,468.15
understand if I tell him your condition,467.88,5.879,470.8195
you don't want that do you,471.24,4.38,473.43
but you won't,473.759,4.981,476.2495
you promised me it's different with Bill,475.62,5.1,478.17
he can work like a maniac day and night,478.74,3.72,480.6
he's as strong as an ox,480.72,4.699,483.0695
but you aren't,482.46,2.959,483.93949999999995
tell me the truth,488.639,2.78,490.029
just a matter of time isn't it,491.58,4.92,494.03999999999996
in a sense that's true of all of us but,493.919,4.381,496.10949999999997
since we're talking about Julia Beck's,496.5,4.199,498.5995
heart I'd say it depends on,498.3,5.299,500.9495
Julie Baker,500.699,2.9,502.149
truly my dear I'm not trying to frighten,506.539,4.72,508.899
you I'm not a prophet,509.28,6.179,512.3695
but I am a doctor and your friend,511.259,7.52,515.019
and this is serious,515.459,3.32,517.1189999999999
it's not myself I'm worried about,519.24,5.159,521.8195000000001
I don't think he'd go on without me,524.399,7.401,528.0995
he could but he wouldn't,527.519,4.281,529.6595
he may have too,532.32,5.78,535.21
if you don't take care of yourself,534.54,3.56,536.3199999999999
I wish I had a child,539.519,6.241,542.6395
I wish so too,542.94,4.74,545.3100000000001
it would be someone for him to cling to,545.76,4.759,548.1395
you could adopt a child,552.839,3.321,554.4995
what they kicked me out of the room for,566.16,3.84,568.0799999999999
because you make him nervous look what,568.44,3.42,570.1500000000001
you're doing to me but once in your life,570.0,5.36,572.68
shut up will you okay okay,571.86,3.5,573.61
look Bill if I was worried I'd tell you,577.32,4.76,579.7
wouldn't I,579.66,2.42,580.87
is she all right Jim,591.44,5.2,594.0400000000001
a couple of weeks in bed and she'll be,594.839,4.081,596.8795
as good as ever a couple of weeks she,596.64,4.199,598.7395
needs the rest that's all and you better,598.92,3.84,600.8399999999999
see that she gets it,600.839,5.221,603.4495000000001
oh well sure she needs a rest you know,602.76,4.56,605.04
you ain't the easiest guy in the world,606.06,3.959,608.0395
to live with I ought to know,607.32,5.959,610.2995000000001
not that I'm complaining,610.019,3.26,611.649
Julie baby don't ever give me a scare,613.74,4.68,616.08
like that again,616.92,4.38,619.11
I almost passed out myself,618.42,5.099,620.9694999999999
now listen you're gonna rest and I mean,621.3,4.2,623.4
rest right here in bed for two weeks,623.519,3.901,625.4695
don't worry about rehearsals don't worry,625.5,4.56,627.78

the lady of shalad that's what it said,830.639,4.44,832.859
when Miss McMasters read about you in,833.16,4.16,835.24
the Poetry,835.079,5.461,837.8095
yes but aren't you the lady in the tower,837.32,5.86,840.25
who had to see the world in a mirror my,840.54,5.239,843.1595
I guess I am hitty,847.56,5.82,850.4699999999999
I was watching for seahorses,850.74,5.76,853.62
I saw some just a minute ago oh,853.38,5.88,856.32
they were happy way out there kicking up,856.5,5.04,859.02
their heels and they had beautiful white,859.26,5.34,861.93
tossing Mains didn't they and blue blue,861.54,6.02,864.55
eyes like sapphires,864.6,4.739,866.9695
all the time I knew you were true,869.339,5.401,872.0395000000001
everything you really believe in is true,872.339,5.461,875.0695000000001
hidey could I ask you a question you,874.74,5.339,877.4095
don't have to tell if it's a secret I'm,877.8,6.479,881.0395
sure you could keep a secret oh yes,880.079,5.94,883.049
did you break the spell and get out of,884.279,3.42,885.989
that boat when you're supposed to be,886.019,3.921,887.9795
you remember in the poem when sir,893.899,4.421,896.1095
Lancelot saw the lady lying in the boat,896.519,4.68,898.859
and said God in his Mercy Grant her,898.32,5.16,900.9000000000001
God must have heard him maybe I'm glad,903.48,6.68,906.82
God happened to be listening,906.839,3.321,908.4995
are those pearls a great prize I believe,912.839,5.641,915.6595000000001
so sir Lancelot gave them to me only,915.66,5.58,918.4499999999999
everybody calls him Bill nowadays Bill,918.48,5.94,921.45
oh yes he's Salon Salat and Robin Hood,921.24,6.959,924.7195
and Bill all rolled up in one is he a,924.42,6.08,927.4599999999999
he doesn't quite reach to the sky hidey,931.699,5.021,934.2094999999999
but he's pretty big,934.44,4.56,936.72

Gypsy stole me when I was a baby and,945.779,3.18,947.369
took me there,947.76,3.18,949.35
Miss McMasters is holding me captive,948.959,4.82,951.3689999999999
until I can raise The Ransom,950.94,5.28,953.58

he just doesn't speak her language,2601.9,4.199,2603.9995
you'll never understand her,2603.52,4.62,2605.83
he's too self-absorbed,2606.099,3.781,2607.9895
he's too used to having you and His,2608.14,4.56,2610.42
World revolve around him,2609.88,6.199,2612.9795

and made some jokes I had my first,2824.44,4.2,2826.54
lesson since I was sick,2826.839,3.901,2828.7895
Julie took me to lunch and everybody,2828.64,3.84,2830.56
looked at her because she is so,2830.74,2.82,2832.1499999999996

it's a lovely diary hoodie,2870.339,3.921,2872.2995
you know hitty we all live more or less,2882.76,5.099,2885.3095000000003
by our dreams,2885.76,4.98,2888.25
I think people like you and me would die,2887.859,5.041,2890.3795
if we couldn't dream,2890.74,3.72,2892.6
Bill's a great dreamer in his own way,2894.46,4.46,2896.69
pity my darling,2910.839,6.121,2913.8995
sometimes we want things so badly,2914.079,4.621,2916.3895
so badly that,2916.96,5.7,2919.81
we don't realize how selfish we are,2918.7,6.899,2922.1495
now I know,2922.66,5.64,2925.48
that nothing really belongs to us that,2925.599,5.161,2928.1795
is bought at somebody else's expense,2928.3,5.059,2930.8295000000003
and we must give it up,2934.119,5.941,2937.0895
no matter at what cost,2936.88,6.32,2940.04
do you think you understand,2940.06,3.14,2941.63
you know how it is with Bill and me how,2948.099,6.02,2951.1090000000004
we love each other,2951.4,2.719,2952.7595
people who love each other must learn to,2954.46,4.32,2956.62
make allowances for each other,2956.38,5.28,2959.02
they don't always see eye to eye on,2958.78,4.68,2961.1200000000003
even important things,2963.46,5.28,2966.1
there's you for instance,2966.4,5.1,2968.9500000000003
Bill sees you one way and,2968.74,5.099,2971.2895
I know what you mean Julie Builders like,2973.839,5.821,2976.7495
me to talk about ibuses and unicorns and,2977.02,4.98,2979.5099999999998
things like that the way you do and you,2979.66,4.199,2981.7594999999997
want me to talk about things he likes,2982.0,5.48,2984.74

all dressed up huh,6.12,4.68,8.46
new suit any good,8.4,4.5,10.65
yeah looks well,10.8,4.799,13.1995
granny huh yeah,12.9,5.82,15.81
when does the train get in oh I got time,15.599,4.68,17.939
fell asleep already this morning and I,22.08,4.92,24.54
let it yeah I know I heard a crying,23.699,7.041,27.219500000000004
yeah she cried hard all right,27.0,3.74,28.87
Dad we made a terrible mistake with her,30.779,3.421,32.4895
somehow she's got to be made to,32.579,3.721,34.4395
understand that Larry's dead it's insane,34.2,3.78,36.09
what she's doing,36.3,5.34,38.97
she might hear us dead walk over the,37.98,6.739,41.3495
garage and they want to talk to you,41.64,3.079,43.1795
my guess is we'll get that stuff out of,45.0,3.12,46.56
your mind because you'll never convince,46.92,3.42,48.63
her but three years nobody comes back,48.12,3.779,50.009499999999996
after three years well you can talk,50.34,3.0,51.84
yourself low in the face but there's no,51.899,3.121,53.4595
body and there's no grave it was,53.34,3.539,55.109500000000004
reported missing that's all so where are,55.02,3.179,56.609500000000004
you just have to look at the newspapers,58.199,4.321,60.3595
every month some boy turns up somewhere,60.18,6.299,63.3295
so the next one is going to be Larry,62.52,5.34,65.19
I'm going to ask hand to marry me,67.86,3.56,69.64
well Annie is Larry's girl she was,72.78,4.32,74.94
engaged to marry him she's not Larry's,75.06,3.419,76.76950000000001
girl how can she be Larry's girl when,77.1,3.48,78.83999999999999
Larry's dead,78.479,4.021,80.48949999999999
but from Mother's point of view he's not,80.58,3.66,82.41
dead and you have no right to take his,82.5,3.119,84.0595
the world's full of girls and you pick,85.619,3.481,87.3595

and with a smile on my face,1305.12,4.74,1307.4899999999998
I was the Beast,1309.86,3.299,1311.5095

some grape juice Kate made it especially,2509.079,5.0,2511.579
for you no thanks,2510.82,3.259,2512.4495
seems impossible in fact,2514.839,5.101,2517.3894999999998
how's the Lord George,2517.839,4.321,2519.9995
I don't know,2519.94,3.78,2521.83
when I was studying it seemed sensible,2522.16,2.82,2523.5699999999997
but outside there doesn't seem to be,2523.72,3.66,2525.5499999999997
much of a law,2524.98,5.72,2527.84
you're not going to marry him,2527.38,3.32,2529.04
why not because his father destroyed,2530.74,3.96,2532.72
your family that's why not now look at,2532.839,4.02,2534.849
you cut it short Chris tell her to come,2534.7,3.72,2536.56
with me let's not argue,2536.859,3.181,2538.4494999999997
who are you to come bullying your way in,2538.42,3.36,2540.1
here like this if you've got something,2540.04,3.66,2541.87
to say say it,2541.78,3.42,2543.4900000000002
I want to see data tell me you're going,2543.7,3.6,2545.5
to be married seemed impossible not to,2545.2,4.139,2547.2695
tell him lately Annie I've been thinking,2547.3,3.539,2549.0695
that maybe we've been wrong not to go,2549.339,3.601,2551.1394999999998
see him it's been bothering me,2550.839,3.841,2552.7595
whatever he did Annie he's our father,2552.94,4.44,2555.16
we've got to remember that that's not,2554.68,3.96,2556.66
what you said when you came back from,2557.38,3.54,2559.15
overseas I know what I said and I did a,2558.64,5.219,2561.2495
terrible thing I can never be forgiven,2560.92,5.159,2563.4995
it wasn't all dad's fault,2563.859,4.321,2566.0195
Joe knew about those cylinders Annie he,2566.079,4.26,2568.2090000000003
knew that's a lie and you know it he was,2568.18,5.159,2570.7594999999997
home sick sick he stayed home to give,2570.339,4.5,2572.589
himself an alibi so all the blame would,2573.339,3.181,2574.9294999999997
fall on dead but all this came out at,2574.839,3.301,2576.4895
the trial dad told the whole story and,2576.52,3.42,2578.23
the jury didn't believe him the jury,2578.14,4.08,2580.18
didn't know him any yesterday I heard it,2579.94,4.379,2582.1295
from his mouth from his mouth it's all,2582.22,3.44,2583.9399999999996
together different from the court record,2584.319,3.601,2586.1195
anybody who knows him and knows your,2585.66,4.0,2587.66
father will believe it from his mouth,2587.92,3.72,2589.78
your father tricked him he took,2589.66,4.679,2591.9995
everything we had I can't beat that but,2591.64,5.16,2594.22

that's the way they do George,2859.9,3.78,2861.79
man makes an honest mistake and they,2861.94,4.82,2864.35
hang him by the thumbs,2863.68,3.08,2865.22
I wish you let me know you're going to,2867.099,3.121,2868.6595
see him I didn't think you're registered,2868.599,3.421,2870.3095000000003
well of course I'm interested why,2870.22,4.74,2872.5899999999997
shouldn't I be I think about him a lot,2872.02,4.559,2874.2995
and I like them to know that as far as,2874.96,3.72,2876.82
I'm concerned anytime he wants he's got,2876.579,3.601,2878.3795
a place with me,2878.68,4.62,2880.99
not as my partner of course but uh a job,2880.18,5.04,2882.7
you don't know of anything dead of,2883.3,3.779,2885.1895000000004
course I don't I know that but uh just,2885.22,4.379,2887.4094999999998
the same you hate your guts Joe did you,2887.079,4.74,2889.449
I imagine it,2894.28,5.52,2897.0400000000004
but I can change too,2896.859,7.26,2900.489
I was never like that he's like that now,2899.8,7.38,2903.4900000000002
well that's a sad thing to hear why,2904.119,5.341,2906.7895000000003
'd you expect him to think of you well,2907.18,4.139,2909.2495
the thing can be sad even if you,2909.46,2.94,2910.93
expected it,2911.319,2.881,2912.7595
I expected it because I happen to know,2912.4,2.939,2913.8695000000002
your father,2914.2,2.639,2915.5195
and I'm sad to see that he hasn't,2915.339,3.921,2917.2995
as long as I've known him,2919.9,6.0,2922.9
25 years that part of made me sad,2921.94,7.879,2925.8795
a man never learned to take the blame,2925.9,3.919,2927.8595
you know that George well yes but you do,2930.099,5.22,2932.7090000000003
know it Because by the way you come in,2933.339,3.301,2934.9895
here you don't look like you remembered,2935.319,2.581,2936.6095
I mean like in uh 37 when we had the,2937.9,4.439,2940.1195000000002
shop on flood Street,2940.599,3.24,2942.219
and he never blew it up with that heater,2942.339,3.061,2943.8695
left burning for two days without any,2943.839,2.821,2945.2495
he wouldn't admit it was his fault,2946.66,2.159,2947.7394999999997
I had to fire a mechanic to save his,2948.819,2.701,2950.1695
you remember that don't you yes well I'm,2951.52,3.299,2953.1695
just mentioning this because this is,2953.319,4.561,2955.5995
just another one of a lot of things,2954.819,5.04,2957.339
like when he gave Frank next door that,2957.88,4.439,2960.0995000000003
money to invest in Oil stock I know well,2959.859,4.5,2962.109
it's good to remember those things,2962.319,4.561,2964.5995
the way he cursed Frank when that stock,2964.359,5.46,2967.089
went down now is that Frank's fault to,2966.88,4.14,2968.9500000000003
listen to him you think Frank was A,2969.819,2.52,2971.079
Swindle and all the man did was just,2971.02,3.72,2972.88
give him a bad tip I know that I'll,2972.339,4.02,2974.349
remember them,2974.74,3.98,2976.7299999999996

a certain man in this world who just,2984.04,4.92,2986.5
haven't got the guts to take the blame,2986.14,5.84,2989.06
you understand me,2988.96,3.02,2990.4700000000003

what I am going to tell you is the truth,3526.619,4.98,3529.109
we were in the midst of all that war,3529.559,3.481,3531.2995
turning out stuff of the army and maybe,3533.04,5.039,3535.5595
night and day night and day now into it,3535.2,6.72,3538.56
places going full blast we only work for,3538.079,6.301,3541.2295000000004

it came out bad or can they be fixed no,3605.16,5.459,3607.8894999999998
nothing start all over again by that,3608.4,4.939,3610.8695000000002
time we're out of business,3610.619,2.72,3611.9790000000003
we shouldn't have gotten into this we,3617.059,5.141,3619.6295
were our head we're not big enough,3619.619,3.96,3621.599
we had no right to take on those,3622.2,3.419,3623.9094999999998
I don't remember you saying that when I,3625.619,3.781,3627.5095
came back from Washington with him,3627.24,3.54,3629.0099999999998
you look at the prophets of the bottom,3629.4,2.399,3630.5995000000003
of the page and you thought we were,3630.78,3.18,3632.3700000000003
plenty big enough then I relied on you,3631.799,4.02,3633.809
you said we could handle it and we can,3633.96,3.48,3635.7
it's because a batch of some of this,3635.819,3.0,3637.319
come out bad,3637.44,3.119,3638.9995
's an old lady,3638.819,3.121,3640.3795
ever since they made him the Army,3640.559,2.52,3641.8190000000004
inspector and gave him that x-ray,3641.94,3.359,3643.6195000000002
machine he's been seeing things,3643.079,4.26,3645.2090000000003
what are they gonna do Joe well what can,3645.299,5.421,3648.0095
we do take the rap,3647.339,3.381,3649.0295
or ship them,3652.74,5.579,3655.5294999999996
ship them how can we,3655.38,6.32,3658.54
accept them that's all,3658.319,3.381,3660.0095
because in the first time we've shipped,3661.98,2.94,3663.45
stuff out of here there wasn't a hundred,3663.72,3.379,3665.4094999999998
do you think every stove that we sent,3667.26,3.42,3668.9700000000003
out of here before the war was perfect,3668.7,4.74,3671.0699999999997
nobody turns out a perfect product,3670.68,5.1,3673.23
but this is different Joe but what do,3673.44,3.419,3675.1495
you want to do not ship them and have,3675.78,2.339,3676.9495
them cancel this out put us out of,3676.859,3.061,3678.3894999999998
business you know what they'll do to us,3678.119,3.781,3680.0095
if we don't deliver,3679.92,3.84,3681.84
will they be all right well I have to be,3681.9,3.36,3683.58
I don't like it for taking an awful,3685.26,3.72,3687.1200000000003
chance if something happens okay then,3687.299,3.78,3689.189
you think of something better,3688.98,3.54,3690.75
either we take the chance or we're,3691.079,4.141,3693.1495
through good and through broke,3692.52,4.38,3694.71
I got every cent in the world tied up in,3696.9,3.179,3698.4895
this place,3698.88,3.66,3700.71
it'll be the end of everything for me,3700.079,4.141,3702.1495
I wouldn't even be able to keep the,3702.54,2.64,3703.86
what makes you think I'm any better off,3705.18,4.8,3707.58
I've got more in my money tied up in,3708.24,4.68,3710.58
this I've got me tied up in it me my,3709.98,5.94,3712.95
flesh and blood my heart my brains 40,3712.92,4.26,3715.05
Years of it,3715.92,4.699,3718.2695
40 hard years,3717.18,3.439,3718.8995
Keller endeavor,3720.72,3.72,3722.58
I guess you don't know what that means,3722.94,3.48,3724.68
because you never had to get her the way,3724.44,3.3,3726.09
I did it was all there for you all you,3726.42,3.899,3728.3695000000002

had to grab it grab it and hold on,3730.319,5.821,3733.2295
when you were working for your father,3734.76,2.88,3736.2000000000003
wearing a white collar and living in the,3736.14,2.76,3737.52

only three dollars and fifty cents,3753.0,4.559,3755.2795
but I would because it was my last three,3755.099,4.321,3757.2595
dollars and fifty cents,3757.559,4.081,3759.5995000000003

dollar and a half profit,3764.22,4.02,3766.23

you joined up with me herb,3771.299,4.921,3773.7595

times when I couldn't meet the payroll,3776.22,6.54,3779.49
yes in the times that the workmen left,3780.24,3.9,3782.1899999999996
on Saturday with more money in their,3782.76,3.66,3784.59
pockets than I took home,3784.14,5.52,3786.9
a time when Kate took a job to pay the,3786.42,5.28,3789.06

your mother,3796.44,4.02,3798.4500000000003
you're only losing money here only money,3798.42,4.32,3800.58
but it's a crime to ship those cylinders,3800.46,4.98,3802.95
out of here you must realize that well,3802.74,4.44,3804.9599999999996
it's only a crime if you get caught the,3805.44,4.2,3807.54
main thing is to survive Joe Keller is,3807.18,3.96,3809.16
going to survive,3809.64,3.3,3811.29

should like to say I didn't because of,3821.04,5.34,3823.71
honesty and principle,3823.38,4.679,3825.7195
but it isn't so,3826.38,4.86,3828.81
I was merely frightened,3828.059,6.8,3831.4590000000003
and so Monday passed,3831.24,3.619,3833.0494999999996
next day was,3834.9,3.02,3836.4100000000003
Black Tuesday they lend the devil to pay,3837.92,6.939,3841.3895
the latent shipping of cylinders we,3842.299,3.941,3844.2695
when the army men were Raising Kane,3846.24,5.579,3849.0294999999996
when they left I called up Joe on the,3849.299,3.901,3851.2495
he was home safe,3853.2,5.639,3856.0195
first time since I've known Joe to stay,3856.559,5.361,3859.2395

no I didn't Joe I'm scared to take the,3874.98,3.98,3876.97
responsibility,3876.54,2.42,3877.75
Joe I'm frightened can't you come down,3881.339,3.421,3883.0495
here and handle it yourself why can I,3883.079,3.421,3884.7895000000003

platform do they go or don't they but,3911.7,3.96,3913.68

for responsibility he said,3927.42,6.179,3930.5095
he'd take full responsibility but you've,3930.42,4.379,3932.6095
told them this in court and they didn't,3933.599,3.301,3935.2495000000004
believe you the judge the jury all those,3934.799,4.081,3936.8395
men they didn't believe you,3936.9,3.959,3938.8795
on the telephone you can't have,3940.859,4.141,3942.9294999999997
responsibility,3942.66,4.8,3945.06
in a court,3945.0,5.52,3947.76
you can always deny it,3947.46,5.099,3950.0095
could be like that,3950.52,6.0,3953.52
he couldn't be I know him he's my father,3952.559,5.701,3955.4095
this is something you rooted about until,3956.52,4.02,3958.53
it's become real deal but it isn't the,3958.26,4.559,3960.5395000000003
truth you know it's not the truth,3960.54,5.1,3963.09
it's the truth Chris,3962.819,6.8,3966.219
it's a truth time's up,3965.64,3.979,3967.6295
the minute the plan still say,3982.74,5.4,3985.4399999999996
if you want to know,3985.68,5.6,3988.48
it's all right Minnie I'll see you again,4006.559,3.621,4008.3695000000002
Annie yes it's me now I come in,4013.46,6.72,4016.82
you surprised me,4020.18,3.2,4021.7799999999997
I thought you were in Chicago how was is,4023.599,4.801,4025.9995000000004
Chris here I found him at the office,4026.48,3.599,4028.2795
they said he hadn't been there he's out,4028.4,4.56,4030.6800000000003
of town for a few days on a vacation oh,4030.079,5.28,4032.719
that's too bad I wanted to talk to him,4032.96,4.32,4035.12
before I spoke to you,4035.359,5.281,4037.9995
but perhaps it's just as well Annie I,4037.28,4.319,4039.4395000000004
don't know what brought you back here,4040.64,2.699,4041.9894999999997
but I'm sorry you came,4041.599,3.96,4043.579
I'm not going to pretend to you,4043.339,4.141,4045.4094999999998
you're not welcome here,4045.559,3.661,4047.3895
I expect it that you'd feel that way,4047.48,4.26,4049.61
Kate but it's not important what's,4049.22,4.319,4051.3795
important is what I have to say you have,4051.74,4.559,4054.0195
nothing to say to me,4053.539,5.101,4056.0895
when I left here last week it was for,4056.299,4.401,4058.4995
good I thought I should never come back,4058.64,5.34,4061.31
but in Chicago I began to figure things,4060.7,5.919,4063.6594999999998
out and I realized that I'd merely run,4063.98,4.98,4066.47
away and that it wouldn't do,4066.619,4.381,4068.8095000000003
it isn't better to leave things the way,4068.96,4.56,4071.2400000000002
they are Kate,4071.0,5.16,4073.58
sometimes they've got to be disturbed,4073.52,4.5,4075.77
what do you want of us,4076.16,3.78,4078.0499999999997
why do you come back in our lives you,4078.02,3.42,4079.73
and George and your father what do you,4079.94,3.96,4081.92
want I want to marry Chris,4081.44,5.04,4083.96
that's impossible and you know it Chris,4083.9,4.32,4086.06
would never marry you as long as Larry,4086.48,3.54,4088.25
is alive he wouldn't do such a thing why,4088.22,3.599,4090.0195
won't you learn to face the truth Kate,4090.02,3.9,4091.97
the truth the truth what good is the,4091.819,4.081,4093.8595
truth if it destroys us all what good is,4093.92,4.22,4096.03
Chris asked me to marry him cake,4098.239,4.62,4100.549
no right to do that and you had no right,4101.179,3.0,4102.679
to let him,4102.859,3.061,4104.3895
Wicked of you both of you and you know,4104.179,3.421,4105.8895
it we love each other,4105.92,4.68,4108.26
you're engaged to Larry Lara is not,4107.6,5.28,4110.240000000001
coming back Kate,4110.6,5.099,4113.1495
No Such Thing No Such Thing New Year,4112.88,5.58,4115.67
he is coming back and when he does if,4115.699,3.901,4117.6494999999995
you want to break it off that's all,4118.46,2.399,4119.6595
right but you've got to wait till he,4119.6,3.54,4121.370000000001

it doesn't depend on me I can change the,4126.02,4.199,4128.119500000001
way things are I don't want to do it,4128.359,3.661,4130.1895
without your consent Kate it would make,4130.219,3.901,4132.1695
Chris unhappy he loves you so it would,4132.02,4.259,4134.1495
break his heart you owe him this much,4134.12,3.659,4135.9495
happiness Kate tell him it's all right,4136.279,4.56,4138.559
it would take more than my words,4137.779,5.52,4140.539000000001
the night you marry him Larry will be,4140.839,4.681,4143.1795

let him take 40 years away,4580.4,5.6,4583.2
let them take my life away,4582.739,3.261,4584.3695
I never thought they'd install them,4588.44,4.08,4590.48
on aside in,4590.54,3.36,4592.22
I thought it'd be stopped somewhere,4592.52,3.48,4594.26
along the line,4593.9,3.48,4595.639999999999
you know they were defective you knew,4596.0,4.02,4598.01

because I did it for you,4616.239,4.48,4618.478999999999
I'm an old man,4618.98,3.239,4620.599499999999

cried like a child before,4708.8,3.379,4710.489500000001
never saw him that way,4712.82,3.08,4714.36
since when did you know it Jim,4718.64,6.98,4722.13
since always I guess,4722.36,3.26,4723.99
you're smart,4726.679,2.841,4728.0995
I always had the feeling that,4730.94,7.219,4734.549499999999
in the back of his head Chris knew,4734.12,4.039,4736.1395
I think it would be such a shock you,4738.8,5.78,4741.6900000000005
don't know your own son,4741.56,3.02,4743.070000000001
you don't think it,4747.199,5.601,4749.9995
go away without,4749.719,3.081,4751.2595
I mean for God,4754.82,4.62,4757.13
he'll be back,4756.5,5.82,4759.41
Chris is a good son he'll come back,4759.44,5.219,4762.049499999999

staying up won't help and sleep well,4775.28,5.64,4778.099999999999
sleep's a wonderful thing,4778.699,4.841,4781.1195
the best thing about living,4780.92,4.14,4782.99
what do you want,4785.06,4.56,4787.34
I don't like it mixing it so much,4787.28,5.04,4789.8
sure he knows,4789.62,4.86,4792.05
how does he know,4792.32,4.859,4794.7495
it's a long time ago,4794.48,5.66,4797.3099999999995
I don't like that,4797.179,2.961,4798.6595
I guess Annie knows too,4800.179,4.98,4802.669
you heard from her no she still read,4802.88,4.319,4805.0395
well they think they're not coming back,4807.199,3.301,4808.849499999999
maybe Chris is with her no,4810.5,5.219,4813.1095
practice just here,4813.56,4.5,4815.81
what is this open house in the middle of,4815.719,3.661,4817.5495
would you like a cup oh you know what it,4819.38,4.64,4821.7
does to me,4821.6,2.42,4822.81
I thought I had a family,4827.179,6.441,4830.3995
what happened to my family cake,4829.88,3.74,4831.75
Joe I was thinking this way,4833.96,4.5,4836.21
if he comes back he is coming back what,4836.239,4.321,4838.3994999999995
do you mean if I think,4838.46,3.54,4840.2300000000005
if you could sit him down and explain,4840.56,2.639,4841.8795
you ought to make it clear to him that,4844.699,5.641,4847.519499999999
you know you did a terrible thing,4846.86,6.08,4849.9
if he saw that you realized what you did,4853.219,4.44,4855.439
ask him to forgive me you mean,4859.699,5.401,4862.3994999999995
something like natural,4862.34,6.56,4865.62
ask my son to forgive me,4865.1,3.8,4867.0
I don't know what happened,4872.0,5.82,4874.91
he wanted money so I made money,4875.179,4.201,4877.2795
man asked to take care of his family,4877.82,2.879,4879.2595
that's the first thing he has to do he,4879.38,3.24,4881.0
has to take care of his family what must,4880.699,3.301,4882.349499999999
I be forgiven,4882.62,3.72,4884.48

do not that way but I didn't want it,4889.219,3.121,4890.7795
that way either,4891.14,2.88,4892.58
what difference is it as long as you've,4892.34,3.96,4894.32
I spoil the both of you,4896.3,3.66,4898.13
I should have put him out when he was 10,4898.46,3.54,4900.2300000000005
like I was put out made him earned,4899.96,3.36,4901.64
Escape then he'd know how a buck has,4902.0,3.84,4903.92
made in this world forgive me,4903.32,5.22,4905.929999999999
I could live on a buck a day myself but,4905.84,5.52,4908.6
I've got a family doesn't excuse it true,4908.54,4.619,4910.8495
that you did it for the family it's got,4911.36,4.2,4913.46
to excuse it there's something bigger,4913.159,4.621,4915.469499999999
than the family to him no no there's,4915.56,4.32,4917.72
nothing bigger than that there's nothing,4917.78,3.959,4919.7595
you could do that I couldn't forgive,4919.88,3.54,4921.650000000001
because I'm his father and he's my son,4921.739,3.301,4923.389499999999
there's nothing bigger than that and,4923.42,2.58,4924.71
you're going to tell them that you,4925.04,3.199,4926.6395
understand,4926.0,2.239,4927.1195
you don't think he'd go to the police,4931.94,4.5,4934.19
sure please,4933.38,5.04,4935.900000000001
he wouldn't do a thing like that not,4938.42,4.58,4940.71
without telling me,4940.219,2.781,4941.6095000000005
where is he,4944.659,5.221,4947.269499999999
going away like this and stop saying a,4947.42,4.319,4949.5795
word not coming back,4949.88,4.14,4951.95

I mean it would have been useless,5047.739,4.201,5049.839499999999
because he doesn't know what he did,5048.94,5.88,5051.879999999999
he doesn't know how awful a thing it was,5051.94,6.239,5055.059499999999
lied to himself and he doesn't know,5054.82,5.16,5057.4

The monochromatic color scheme enhances the contrasts and textures within the image, drawing attention to the composition and the interaction between the subjects. The facial expressions and body language of the men suggest a sense of determination or resolve, further adding to the narrative of the image. The rifles held by the men could indicate a conflict or a march towards an unknown destination.

The photograph is framed with trees in the foreground, providing depth and perspective to the scene. The positioning of the riders on one side and the horses on the other creates a sense of balance within the frame, while also guiding the viewer's eye through the image from left to right.

Overall, the film-maker has successfully employed various elements such as camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, character positioning, and visual effects to create a powerful and evocative scene. The black and white color scheme adds an element of timelessness to the photograph, allowing viewers to focus on the composition and narrative without being distracted by color.

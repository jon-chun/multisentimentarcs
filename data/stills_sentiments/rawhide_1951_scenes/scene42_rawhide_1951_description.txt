This black and white still is from the movie "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" featuring Clint Eastwood. The character, Don Miguel, is portrayed in a moment of intense focus as he stands with his gun drawn in a saloon. His attire consists of a denim jacket, a bandana tied around his neck, and a cowboy hat. The background reveals a wooden structure with a thatched roof and a dirt floor. A large rock formation can be seen on the left side of the image. The sepia tone of the photo adds to its western aesthetic.

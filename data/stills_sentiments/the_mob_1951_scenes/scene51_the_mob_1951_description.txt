This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the 1960s. The image features three men, each with distinct expressions and attire.

In the center of the frame stands a man donned in a plaid shirt and a beret, his face displaying a serious expression. To his left, another man is seen wearing a military uniform and a cap, his gaze directed towards the camera. On the right side of the central figure, there's a third man dressed in a checked shirt and a hat, looking away from the camera.

The trio is positioned in front of a wall adorned with windows. A sign that reads "Walter" is prominently displayed on this backdrop. The image exudes an air of solemnity and intrigue, characteristic of the 1960s era.

To his right, there's an unidentified actor, also dressed in a black suit and tie, playing the role of another secret agent. The background is simple yet effective, featuring a wooden door that adds depth to the scene. The overall composition creates a sense of intrigue and suspense, characteristic of the movie's genre.

To the side, Sian Keaton plays the character of Rosaleen Cartwright, her presence adding a layer of complexity to the scene.

The room they are in is simple, the walls painted a stark white that contrasts with the dark clothing worn by the characters. A window punctuates one wall, its curtains drawn back to let in light that illuminates the scene.

This black and white movie still captures a moment from the classic film "Casablanca". The two main characters, played by Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains, are positioned in front of a large window. Both men are dressed formally, with Bogart wearing a suit and tie, while Rains is in a crisp white shirt and black vest.

Bogart, standing on the left side of the frame, holds a letter in his hand, suggesting he might be delivering or receiving it. His gaze is directed towards Rains, indicating an ongoing conversation or exchange between them. 

Rains, standing to Bogart's right, looks off to the side, possibly at something happening outside the frame. His posture and expression are not clear from this angle, but his attention seems divided.

The large window behind them fills the background of the image, offering a view of the cityscape. The high-angle perspective of the shot adds a sense of depth and scale to the scene.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of intrigue and tension, as we are left to wonder about the contents of the letter and the nature of their conversation.

Two individuals are standing next to him - one dressed in a blue suit and the other in a brown coat. They seem to be engaged in conversation with the man at the table.

The image captures an interesting interaction between these three characters. The man at the table appears to be surprised or amused by something, as indicated by his facial expression.

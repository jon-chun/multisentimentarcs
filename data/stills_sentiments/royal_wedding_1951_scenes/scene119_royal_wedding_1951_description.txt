The image presents a scene from the movie "Mank", featuring actor Gary Oldman in the titular role. He is standing in front of a green storefront with a sign that reads "Hax". Dressed in a houndstooth coat and hat, Oldman's character embodies the persona of Mank Pomeroy, an early film industry executive. His arms are crossed over his chest, suggesting a defensive or closed-off stance. The image captures a moment where he is being assisted by another person who is adjusting his tie behind him, possibly indicating a preparation for an important meeting or event.

This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Man Who Knew Too Much". In the center of the image, the renowned actor Alain Delon stands in a suit, his hand casually resting on his hip. He is positioned in front of a man seated at a desk. The man behind the desk is dressed in a gray suit and appears to be deep in thought. To the right of the frame, another man can be seen sitting at a table, observing the scene. The room they are in has a window with curtains visible in the background. The overall composition suggests a tense moment in the narrative of the film.

This is a black and white photograph capturing the actor Alain Delon, known for his portrayal of the character Paul Jusquet in the film "The Swimmer". He stands with a contemplative expression on his face, deep in thought. His attire consists of a houndstooth suit, adding to the sophistication of his character. The background features a window, subtly suggesting an indoor setting. A blurred figure can be seen in the foreground, possibly another character from the film or the photographer's assistant. The black and white color scheme enhances the timeless quality of this cinematic moment.

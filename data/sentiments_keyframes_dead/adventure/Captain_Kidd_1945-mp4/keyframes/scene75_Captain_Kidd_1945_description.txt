This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of intense conversation between two men in a room. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and tie, leans forward with his arms crossed, indicating a defensive or aggressive stance. His facial expression mirrors this sentiment, suggesting he is deeply engrossed in the discussion.

On the right, another man, also wearing a suit and tie, listens attentively. He holds a glass of whiskey in his hand, which rests on a table covered with a white tablecloth. The table also holds a box of cigarettes, adding to the atmosphere of the scene.

The room they are in is dimly lit, creating an intimate setting for their conversation. A window can be seen in the background, suggesting it might be night outside. The positioning of the men and their props - the man's crossed arms and the glass of whiskey - along with the lighting and setting, all contribute to a sense of drama and tension in this image.

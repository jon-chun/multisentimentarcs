In the image, there are two men standing in a room with a stone wall and a window. The man on the left is wearing a white shirt and has his back turned to the camera. He appears to be looking at the other man. The man on the right is dressed in a beige shirt and is facing the camera. His facial expression suggests that he is surprised or startled. The room they are in has a stone wall, which adds a rustic feel to the scene. A window can be seen in the background, suggesting that the room might be located in an older building. The color palette of the image is muted, with the beige shirt of the man on the right standing out against the darker tones of the stone wall and window.

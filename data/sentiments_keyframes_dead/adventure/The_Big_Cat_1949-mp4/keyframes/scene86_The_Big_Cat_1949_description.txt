The image captures a poignant scene from the movie "Forrest Gump". The central focus is on two characters, Forrest Gump and Jenny Curran, positioned in a room with stone walls. Forrest Gump, standing to the left of the frame, is dressed in a white shirt and blue jeans, his face etched with an expression of sadness. On the right side of the image, Jenny Curran is seated on a chair, her attire consisting of a white blouse and black pants. She too shares the same sad expression as Forrest Gump. The room they are in is dimly lit, adding to the overall somber mood of the scene.

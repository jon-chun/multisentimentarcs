In the image, there are two men in a room with rustic wooden walls and furniture. The man on the left is wearing a blue shirt and brown pants, standing next to a fireplace. He has his hand on his hip and is looking at the other man with a smile on his face. The man on the right is dressed in a white shirt and red tie, holding a drink in his hand. He is looking at the first man with a surprised expression. The room they are in has a wooden floor and a window in the background. There is also a coat hanging on the wall.

Timon, a meerkat, is perched on a branch while Pumbaa, a warthog, stands on the ground below. The background features a savanna landscape with trees and grass, providing a natural setting for the characters. The color palette is dominated by earth tones, with some greenery from the tree and grass adding contrast. The lighting is diffused, casting soft shadows and highlighting the characters against the backdrop.

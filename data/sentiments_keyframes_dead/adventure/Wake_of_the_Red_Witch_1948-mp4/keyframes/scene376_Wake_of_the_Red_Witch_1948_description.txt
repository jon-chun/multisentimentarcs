The camera angle is from above, looking down at him, further emphasizing his commanding presence. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting Delon's face and casting shadows that add depth to the scene. Framing and composition are meticulously arranged to focus on Delon, with the desk in front of him and the room's grandeur serving as a backdrop. Color is rich and vibrant, from Delon's white suit to the gold chandeliers, creating a visually striking image. Body language and gestures convey Delon's character's confidence and resolve. Props and costumes are meticulously detailed, including the desk, chandeliers, paintings, and Delon's attire. Depth of field is shallow, with Delon in sharp focus and the room blurred, drawing attention to him.

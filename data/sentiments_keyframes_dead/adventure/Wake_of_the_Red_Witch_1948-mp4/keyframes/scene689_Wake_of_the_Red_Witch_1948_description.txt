In the image, there are two women standing in a room with a window and curtains. The woman on the left is wearing a purple dress and has her hands clasped together. She appears to be in a state of worry or concern. On the right, another woman is dressed in a white dress adorned with red flowers. She seems to be in a state of sadness or melancholy. The room they are in has a window with curtains drawn back, allowing light to filter into the room. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling, adding an element of elegance to the scene. The colors in the image are predominantly purple and white, creating a contrast between the two women's dresses. The positioning of the women, one on each side of the frame, creates a sense of balance in the composition.

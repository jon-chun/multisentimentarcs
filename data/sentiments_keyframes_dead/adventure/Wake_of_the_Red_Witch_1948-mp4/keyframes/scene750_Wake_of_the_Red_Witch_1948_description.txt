In the image, there are two men in a room with white walls and a wooden floor. The man on the left is wearing a black shirt and has his back to the camera. He appears to be looking at something off-camera. On the right, another man is dressed in a blue suit and hat, facing the camera directly. His gaze seems to be directed towards the man in the black shirt. The room they are in is sparsely furnished, with only a few pieces of furniture visible in the background. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a serious or formal setting.

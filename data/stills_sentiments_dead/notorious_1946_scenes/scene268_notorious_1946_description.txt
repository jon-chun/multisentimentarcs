In this black and white photo, a man and a woman are seated on a couch in a living room. The man is positioned to the left and the woman to the right. Both of them have their arms resting on the backrest of the couch. The man has a slight smile on his face, while the woman looks away with her head turned to the side. 

On the armrest where the man's hand rests, there is a glass of water. A lamp can be seen in the background, adding to the domestic setting of the scene. The window in the background has blinds partially drawn, suggesting it might be daytime outside. 

The composition of the image places the subjects centrally within the frame, drawing attention to their expressions and body language. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene.

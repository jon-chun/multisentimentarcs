In this black and white photograph, we see the renowned actor Alain Delon standing in a room. He is positioned slightly to the left of center, looking directly at the camera with a serious expression on his face. His attire consists of a dark suit complemented by a white shirt and black tie. The setting appears to be indoors, with a window visible in the background adorned with curtains. A potted plant can also be seen near the window. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to this portrait of Alain Delon.

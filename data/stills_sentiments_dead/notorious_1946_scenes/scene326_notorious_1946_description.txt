The man's facial expression is serious, suggesting deep thought or contemplation. His posture, with one leg crossed over the other, further emphasizes this introspective mood. The cigarette he holds seems to be more than just a prop; it's a symbol of his character and state of mind.

The composition of the photograph is well-balanced, with the man centrally positioned on the bench. This placement draws the viewer's attention directly to him, reinforcing his as the main subject of this image.

In terms of setting, the background features a stone wall adorned with arches, adding an architectural element to the scene. A vase can be seen in the top left corner of the photo, providing a touch of elegance and refinement.

Despite being a black and white image, it's rich in detail and emotion. The film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, body language, and visual effects to create a captivating narrative around this solitary figure.

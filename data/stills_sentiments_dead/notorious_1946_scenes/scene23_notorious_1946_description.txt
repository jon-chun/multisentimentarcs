His attire consists of a suit and tie, adding to the formal ambiance of the scene. His facial expression is one of concern or worry, suggesting an intense moment in the plot. The camera angle is close-up, focusing on his face and upper body. This framing technique emphasizes his emotions and adds depth to the image. The lighting in the room appears natural, coming from the windows behind him. The background features a curtain that complements the overall composition of the photograph. Despite the absence of color, the image effectively conveys the mood and tension of the scene.

This black and white photograph captures a dramatic scene. In the foreground, a man in a cowboy hat is holding a large tree branch with both hands, bending it towards the ground. He is standing in front of a brick building that has a window and a door. The background features a rocky hillside dotted with shrubs. The man's body language suggests effort and determination as he handles the branch. The photograph is taken from a slightly elevated angle, looking down at the man and his task, emphasizing the size of the branch compared to him.

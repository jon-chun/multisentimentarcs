In the black and white photograph, a woman stands in front of a brick wall. She is dressed in a long skirt and a blouse adorned with a lace collar. The woman holds a basket in her left hand and gazes into the distance, her gaze directed towards something beyond the frame of the image. 

The background reveals a garden, filled with various plants and shrubs, lending an air of tranquility to the scene. A window punctuates the brick wall behind the woman, its glass reflecting the surroundings. The entire image is captured from a low angle, placing emphasis on the woman's figure against the backdrop of the brick wall and garden.

The use of black and white in the photograph evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminiscent of early photographic techniques. The composition and lighting contribute to a serene atmosphere, while the woman's attire suggests a simpler time period. The image captures not just a moment in time but also tells a story about the woman and her environment.

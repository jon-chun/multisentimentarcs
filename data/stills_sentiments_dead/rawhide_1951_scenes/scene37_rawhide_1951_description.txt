This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in time featuring the actor Alain Delon. He is positioned against the backdrop of a brick building, which has a sign that reads "STATION". Alain Delon is seated on a bench, holding a cigarette in his hand, lost in thought. His attire consists of a cowboy hat and jacket, adding to the rugged charm of the scene. The photograph is taken from a low angle, placing emphasis on his face as he looks off into the distance. The lighting and composition of the image create a sense of solitude and introspection.

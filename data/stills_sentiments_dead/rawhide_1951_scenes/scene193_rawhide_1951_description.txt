This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". The image features two main subjects: Clint Eastwood, portraying his character as "Blondie", and Lee Van Cleef.

Clint Eastwood, standing in the foreground on the right side of the frame, is dressed in a light-colored jacket and dark pants. He holds a rifle in his hand, his face etched with a determined expression.

On the left side of the frame, Lee Van Cleef's character, "The Man with No Name", is seen lying down with his back towards the camera. His attire consists of a dark jacket and light pants, providing a stark contrast to Eastwood's character.

They are situated in front of a brick building which serves as their backdrop. The scene is further enhanced by the presence of barrels scattered around them, adding to the rustic ambiance of the setting.

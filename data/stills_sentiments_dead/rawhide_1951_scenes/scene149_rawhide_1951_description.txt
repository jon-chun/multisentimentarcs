The image is a black and white still from the film "Pulp Fiction". The main focus of the image is John Travolta, portraying the character of Vincent Vega. He is standing in front of a horse-drawn cart on a beach, positioned towards the right side of the frame. His body language suggests he is walking towards something or someone off-camera. He's dressed in a dark jacket and pants, holding a cigarette in his left hand. The backdrop features a large rock formation under a cloudy sky, adding to the dramatic effect of the scene.

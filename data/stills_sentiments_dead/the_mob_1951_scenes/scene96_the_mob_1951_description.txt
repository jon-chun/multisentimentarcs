This black and white photograph captures a scene from the 1960s, featuring three men in suits. They are standing in front of a large ship, which is docked at a port with various other ships visible in the background. The man on the left is turned away from the camera, seemingly engrossed in something off-frame. The middle man is facing the camera, his gaze directed towards the viewer. The man on the right is looking to the side, perhaps distracted by something out of frame. All three men are wearing hats and ties, indicative of the fashion of the time period. The ship they stand before has a large crane attached to it, suggesting that this might be a commercial port or dockyard. The relative positions of the men and their engagement with each other and their surroundings create a dynamic scene that tells a story open to interpretation.

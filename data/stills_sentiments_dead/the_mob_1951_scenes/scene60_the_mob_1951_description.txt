The image captures a moment of a person holding up an identification card for the Longmont House's Union Station. The card, issued to Timothy Flynn in 1982, is marked with a red stamp, indicating it has been used. The hand of the person holding the card appears to be resting on another card that is also issued by the same institution. The background is blurred, focusing attention on the cards and the action of presenting them. This image evokes a sense of nostalgia and curiosity about the history associated with these two cards.

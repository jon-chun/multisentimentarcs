This image captures a moment from the film "I Am Sam", featuring the actor Sean Penn in his role as Samuel "Sam" Bernard. The setting is a car, with Sam and a social worker, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, seated in the backseat. Sam, donned in a black suit and tie, gazes out of the window, lost in thought, while Pfeiffer's character looks at him with an expression of concern. The monochrome palette adds a timeless quality to this poignant scene.

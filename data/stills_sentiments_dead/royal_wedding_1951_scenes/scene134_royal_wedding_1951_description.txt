In the image, two men are seated in a bar setting. The man on the left is elegantly dressed in a black suit and top hat, holding a drink in his hand. His companion on the right, donning a gray suit and black bowler hat, is also holding a drink. Both of them are looking off to the side with serious expressions on their faces.

The bar itself has a red carpeted floor and a large mirror adorning its wall. The lighting in the image comes from a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, casting a warm glow over the scene. Framing the image is a window with curtains pulled back, adding depth to the composition. The overall atmosphere of the image is one of sophistication and mystery.

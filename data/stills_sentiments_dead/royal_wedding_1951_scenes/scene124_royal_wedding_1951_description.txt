This is a detailed description of the image:

The image captures a scene from the movie "Ocean's Eleven" featuring actors Brad Pitt and George Clooney. They are positioned in front of a bar, with an array of bottles and glasses adorning the shelves in the background.

On the left, Brad Pitt is seen wearing a black suit paired with a white shirt and a black bow tie. He holds a cigar in his hand and has a confident expression on his face as he looks towards George Clooney.

George Clooney, on the right, is dressed in a gray suit complemented by a blue vest and a black bow tie. He too is looking at Brad Pitt with an equally assertive gaze.

The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a tense interaction between the two characters, possibly indicative of their roles as rival thieves in the movie. The precise positioning of the actors and the objects around them contribute to this narrative interpretation.

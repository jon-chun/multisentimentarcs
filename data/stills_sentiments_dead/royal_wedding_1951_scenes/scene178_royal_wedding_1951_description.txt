Two white horses stand ready on either side of the carriage, their bodies gleaming under the light. They are harnessed together, suggesting they are part of this grand spectacle.

The background is bustling with activity as people mill about a street lined with buildings. The image is taken from an interesting perspective - it's as if we're looking down at this scene from above, providing a comprehensive view of the carriage and its surroundings.

This image captures a vibrant scene from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". In the foreground, two characters are prominently featured. The first character is a man dressed in a black and white striped suit, topped with a straw hat. His face lights up with a warm smile as he looks directly at the camera.

Beside him, a woman in a bright yellow dress adds a splash of color to the scene. She too is looking at the camera, her expression mirroring that of the man's. Both characters are positioned slightly off-center to the right, adding an element of dynamism to the composition.

The background features a brick building adorned with green shutters, lending an urban feel to the setting. A yellow awning extends from the building, echoing the color of the woman's dress and creating a harmonious color palette within the image.

Overall, this still captures the essence of the movie - its colorful characters, dynamic composition, and lively atmosphere.

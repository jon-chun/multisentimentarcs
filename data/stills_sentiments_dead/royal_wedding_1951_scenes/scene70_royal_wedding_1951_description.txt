The image captures a scene from the movie "Tootsie" featuring the characters played by actors Gene Kelly and Teri Garr. In the frame, Gene Kelly is positioned on the left side, dressed in a white shirt adorned with a yellow tie, holding a cigarette casually between his fingers. He exudes an air of nonchalance, his gaze directed off to the side. On the right side of the frame, Teri Garr is seen wearing a navy blue suit complemented by a crisp white shirt and a black tie. She looks directly at the camera, her expression one of surprise or shock. The setting appears to be an office environment, with a desk and lamp visible in the background, adding to the authenticity of their character portrayals.

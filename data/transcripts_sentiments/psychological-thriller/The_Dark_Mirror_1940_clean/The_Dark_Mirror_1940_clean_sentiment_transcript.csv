days a week and beat him at it every,2705.52,2.7,2706.87,0.0,0.0,0.7
time he doesn't frighten me with that,2706.9,3.24,2708.52,0.2584,0.0,0.7
but it's you I'm worried about,2710.14,3.439,2711.8595,-0.4215,0.0,-0.7
it shows your mind still on that thing,2714.4,3.419,2716.1095,0.0,0.0,0.7
and you can't deny it when he said,2715.96,3.54,2717.73,0.2584,0.0,0.7
mirror and you automatically said death,2717.819,3.601,2719.6195,-0.5994,0.0,-0.7
that proved it it may not mean a thing,2719.5,3.18,2721.09,0.0,0.15625,-0.5
to him but it does to me because I,2721.42,2.88,2722.86,0.0,0.0,0.3
understand some of that mumbo jumbo and,2722.68,3.24,2724.3,0.0,0.0,0.3
it's a dead giveaway that it's still in,2724.3,2.94,2725.77,-0.6486,-0.2,0.3
your mind and I had something to do with,2725.92,3.5,2727.67,0.0,0.0,0.4
Harry please,2730.78,6.48,2734.02,0.3182,0.0,-0.7
so I've told you why do you why do you,2732.7,6.6,2736.0,0.0,0.0,0.7
keep saying a thing like that,2737.26,4.559,2739.5395000000003,0.3612,0.0,0.6
forget it but you've no right even to,2739.3,4.2,2741.4,-0.5023,-0.14285714285714285,-0.7
why do you take those sleeping pills,2743.5,3.599,2745.2995,0.0,0.0,-0.7
every night because I can't sleep,2745.3,4.92,2747.76,0.0,0.0,-0.7

haven't gotten over everything yet,2752.079,5.881,2755.0195000000003,0.0,0.0,-0.7
neither of us has is that all,2754.9,5.52,2757.6600000000003,0.0,0.0,-0.6
what other reason could there be,2757.96,4.859,2760.3895,0.0,-0.125,0.2
not your conscience perhaps,2760.42,4.98,2762.91,0.0,0.0,-0.7
my conscience about what,2762.819,4.5,2765.069,0.0,0.0,-0.7
perhaps you're sorry you didn't tell the,2765.4,4.08,2767.44,-0.0772,-0.5,0.2
police all you know,2767.319,4.5,2769.569,0.0,0.0,-0.7
maybe that's what's troubling you,2769.48,4.379,2771.6695,-0.5423,0.0,-0.4
maybe you're thinking you should do it,2771.819,4.561,2774.0995,0.0,0.0,0.4
even now but that's utterly ridiculous,2773.859,4.98,2776.349,-0.5704,-0.3333333333333333,-0.7
such a thought never ended my head,2776.38,4.38,2778.57,0.0,0.0,-0.7

you think I'm here just humoring the old,2843.579,4.921,2846.0395000000003,0.4767,0.1,-0.7
Professor I imagine at all,2845.859,4.621,2848.1695,0.0,0.0,0.6
oh nothing else to do,2848.5,3.78,2850.39,0.0,0.0,-0.7
hadn't it ever occurred to you that I,2850.48,3.18,2852.07,0.0,0.0,-0.7
might like seeing you,2852.28,3.96,2854.26,0.3612,0.0,0.7

you like to see me,2856.24,3.54,2858.01,0.3612,0.0,0.7
if you knew how anxious I was for you to,2857.56,3.66,2859.39,-0.25,-0.25,0.7
get here this afternoon you wouldn't,2859.78,3.0,2861.28,0.0,0.0,-0.7
have to ask that,2861.22,2.879,2862.6595,0.0,0.0,-0.7
very honest then maybe we could see each,2864.099,4.621,2866.4095,0.5563,0.78,0.7
other outside the office sometime well,2866.619,4.081,2868.6595,0.2732,-0.0625,0.6
we will I'm sure,2868.72,5.28,2871.36,0.3182,0.5,0.6
would you like to very much all right,2870.7,5.34,2873.37,0.3612,0.27285714285714285,0.4
uh but not until we finish with these,2876.04,3.9,2877.99,0.0,0.0,-0.7
tests I'm afraid what's that got to do,2878.02,2.94,2879.49,0.0,-0.6,-0.7
look it's hard enough for me to keep my,2880.96,4.139,2883.0295,-0.1027,-0.14583333333333334,-0.7
mind on science as it is please don't,2882.76,4.859,2885.1895000000004,0.3182,0.0,-0.7
make it any more difficult for me all,2885.099,4.861,2887.5295,-0.4201,0.0,-0.7

Terry simply couldn't stand him she,2901.66,2.88,2903.1,0.0,0.0,-0.7
insisted he wasn't on the level and,2903.22,2.7,2904.57,0.0,0.0,-0.7
that's the way it turned out he wasn't,2904.54,3.66,2906.37,0.0,0.0,-0.7
how'd you find out he dated her while,2905.92,4.5,2908.17,0.0,0.0,-0.7

I didn't promise you a great deal more,3540.299,3.961,3542.2795,0.4833,0.65,-0.7

capable of that sort of thing that I,3546.48,4.02,3548.49,0.3818,0.2,0.6
know that does narrow it down a bit,3548.099,5.821,3551.0095,0.0,-0.1777777777777778,-0.7
though Terry's a paranoic paranoic has,3550.5,4.92,3552.96,0.0,0.0,0.2
no more conscience no more sense of,3553.92,3.62,3555.73,-0.5688,-0.25,-0.7

paranoia is capable of anything,3557.54,5.92,3560.5,0.1531,0.2,0.7
that's something but not much you can't,3561.0,4.079,3563.0395,0.0,-0.1,0.4

urgency and mystery no I was just,4214.219,3.601,4216.0195,-0.296,0.0,0.3
puzzled that you felt you had to have,4216.44,3.9,4218.389999999999,-0.1779,0.0,0.2
some excuse I'd have come anyway you you,4217.82,3.6,4219.62,0.0772,-0.05,0.3
but it wasn't an excuse I was quite,4223.82,3.54,4225.59,-0.0857,-0.05,0.4
serious it's something I thought we,4226.219,3.301,4227.8695,-0.0772,-0.3333333333333333,-0.5
should discuss right away privately but,4227.36,3.839,4229.2795,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.3
has it got to be tonight well I'm afraid,4229.52,3.42,4231.2300000000005,0.2732,-0.6,-0.7
so dear it's quite important it's about,4231.199,3.121,4232.759499999999,0.6106,0.4,0.7
you don't like Terry do you of course I,4234.32,4.859,4236.7495,-0.2755,0.0,0.3
like her but what,4236.9,3.48,4238.639999999999,0.1901,0.0,0.2

do I love you why me not her that's,4243.92,5.7,4246.77,0.6369,0.5,0.6
something I'm very curious about why did,4247.4,4.799,4249.7995,0.3804,-0.13,0.7
you choose me instead of her we're so,4249.62,4.619,4251.9295,0.0,0.0,0.4
much alike what was it you thought you,4252.199,4.681,4254.5395,0.0,0.2,0.2
saw on me that you didn't see in her,4254.239,5.041,4256.759499999999,0.0,0.0,-0.7
how can I answer that,4256.88,4.62,4259.1900000000005,0.0,0.0,0.2
all I know is that you're the one I fell,4259.28,4.919,4261.7395,0.0,0.0,0.8
in love with what else do I have to know,4261.5,4.86,4263.93,0.6369,0.5,0.8
am I better looking than,4264.199,4.081,4266.2395,0.4404,0.5,-0.7
to me you are of course,4266.36,2.94,4267.83,0.0,0.0,0.7
don't laugh,4268.28,2.399,4269.4795,-0.4449,0.3,-0.7
I want to know what you think the,4270.679,3.781,4272.5695000000005,0.0772,0.0,0.3
difference is,4272.54,3.72,4274.4,0.0,0.0,0.2
for instance,4274.46,4.4,4276.66,0.0,0.0,0.5
now do you really believe you could tell,4282.44,4.32,4284.599999999999,0.0,0.2,-0.7
that from one of Terry's or my lips from,4284.12,4.82,4286.53,0.0,0.0,0.2
I think so,4290.06,3.42,4291.77,0.0,0.0,0.4
have you ever kissed Terry,4291.44,5.04,4293.96,0.3818,0.0,0.3
no well then how could you possibly know,4293.48,5.58,4296.27,-0.2057,0.0,-0.7
how could you even say such a thing,4296.48,4.98,4298.969999999999,0.0,0.0,-0.8
I'm not sure but,4299.06,5.34,4301.7300000000005,-0.1232,-0.25,0.2
I think I'd know in my heart,4301.46,4.68,4303.8,0.6369,0.0,0.6
would you really,4304.4,3.24,4306.02,0.0,0.2,0.2
I think so,4306.14,3.059,4307.6695,0.0,0.0,0.6
of course I don't believe it for a,4307.64,3.72,4309.5,0.0,0.0,-0.7
second but I wanted to ask you anyway,4309.199,4.621,4311.509499999999,0.0,0.0,0.2
because well after all it's Terry they,4311.36,4.62,4313.67,0.2732,0.0,0.7
usually go for she's the one that really,4313.82,5.1,4316.37,0.0,-0.024999999999999994,0.5
sends them but that's not true,4315.98,6.42,4319.19,-0.4585,-0.175,0.7
of course it's true Terry's a smart one,4318.92,5.94,4321.89,0.6705,0.28214285714285714,-0.7
I've told you that before,4322.4,3.839,4324.3195,0.0,0.0,-0.7
no they don't go for a while,4326.239,3.781,4328.1295,-0.296,0.0,-0.7
that's the trouble with it that's what I,4328.28,3.419,4329.9895,-0.4019,-0.2,-0.7
wanted to talk to you about,4330.02,4.44,4332.240000000001,0.0,0.0,0.3
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean,4331.699,4.621,4334.009499999999,0.0,-0.45625,-0.7
well it's not an easy thing to tell you,4334.46,4.199,4336.5595,-0.0788,0.43333333333333335,-0.5
but I I feel that I should,4336.32,4.08,4338.36,0.0,0.0,-0.5
Terry's uh,4338.659,5.461,4341.389499999999,0.0,0.0,0.2
she's not well she's sick inside and she,4340.4,5.64,4343.219999999999,0.2235,-0.7142857142857143,-0.7
needs help from you and from me if,4344.12,3.599,4345.9195,0.4019,0.0,0.4
Twisted inside,4352.34,4.379,4354.529500000001,0.0,-0.5,-0.7
how it got started I don't know some,4354.5,3.78,4356.39,0.0,0.0,-0.5
incident when you were babies I imagine,4356.719,3.601,4358.5195,0.0,0.0,0.2
that you've both forgotten,4358.28,4.14,4360.349999999999,-0.2263,0.0,-0.7
but there's a natural strong rivalry,4360.32,3.54,4362.09,0.8271,0.26666666666666666,0.6
between sisters,4362.42,3.96,4364.4,0.0,0.0,0.7
and ever since that incident whatever it,4363.86,4.68,4366.2,0.0,0.0,-0.7
was it's grown more and more bitter in,4366.38,4.44,4368.6,-0.5198,0.3,0.2
her until now it's,4368.54,4.74,4370.91,0.0,0.0,-0.7
it's abnormal and she needs care and,4370.82,4.379,4373.0095,0.4939,0.0,0.4
attention right away,4373.28,4.7,4375.63,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.6
Terry and I have never been Rivals never,4375.199,5.161,4377.7795,0.0,0.0,0.8
at the slightest,4377.98,4.96,4380.459999999999,0.0,0.0,0.3
all women are Rivals fundamentally but,4380.36,3.9,4382.31,0.0,0.0,-0.7
it never bothers them because they,4382.94,3.0,4384.44,0.1511,0.0,0.4
automatically discount the successes of,4384.26,3.66,4386.09,0.5574,0.0,-0.7
others and Alibi their own failures on,4385.94,3.9,4387.889999999999,-0.4588,0.6,0.4
the grounds of circumstances,4387.92,3.72,4389.78,0.0,0.0,0.4
luck they say,4389.84,3.6,4391.64,0.4588,0.0,0.3
but between sisters it's a little more,4391.64,4.14,4393.71,0.0,0.15625,0.4
serious the circumstances are generally,4393.44,4.62,4395.75,-0.0772,-0.14166666666666666,0.2
about the same so they have fewer,4395.78,4.74,4398.15,0.0,0.0,-0.7
excuses with which to comfort themselves,4398.06,4.74,4400.43,0.3612,0.0,0.2

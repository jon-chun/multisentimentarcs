different kinds of minds,1499.76,3.44,1501.48,0.0,0.0,0.4
generally speaking i think you could say,1501.6,3.76,1503.48,0.0,0.05000000000000002,0.3
that three types of people come here to,1503.2,2.959,1504.6795,0.0,0.0,0.2
the first a fairly large group come here,1506.159,4.64,1508.479,0.0,0.23214285714285715,0.4
and sometimes a few of them remain to,1510.799,3.441,1512.5195,0.0,-0.2,0.2
the seconds have child-like credulous,1514.24,4.96,1516.72,0.0,0.0,0.4
minds they long to believe,1517.12,6.72,1520.4799999999998,0.0,-0.05,0.4
they're tired and sad and need comfort,1519.2,8.079,1523.2395,-0.5423,-0.45,0.7
all this helps them it creates,1523.84,6.48,1527.08,0.5719,0.0,-0.7
an atmosphere you see,1527.279,5.76,1530.159,0.0,0.0,0.3
a mood like music and in it they find a,1530.32,4.8,1532.72,0.3612,0.0,0.7
few brief moments of comfort which,1533.039,3.921,1534.9995,0.3612,-0.1,0.4
helps them to continue with their grey,1535.12,3.919,1537.0794999999998,0.4215,-0.05,0.4
little lives,1536.96,3.92,1538.92,0.0,-0.1875,0.4
and so i do not think it is so childish,1539.039,3.681,1540.8795,-0.4341,-0.2,0.2
after all do you,1540.88,5.679,1543.7195000000002,0.0,0.0,0.5

i feel that you have come here today to,1552.08,4.56,1554.36,0.0,0.0,-0.7

it might be dangerous how could paul's,1578.08,6.16,1581.16,-0.4767,-0.6,-0.7
presence possibly be dangerous to me,1581.279,6.241,1584.3995,-0.4767,-0.6,0.8

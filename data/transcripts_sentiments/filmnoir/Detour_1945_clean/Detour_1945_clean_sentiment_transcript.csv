like a log,1308.72,3.6,1310.52,0.3612,0.0,0.2
after a while i began to get sleepy,1310.48,4.24,1312.6,0.0,0.0,0.4
i was happy though,1314.72,4.079,1316.7595,0.5719,0.8,0.7
soon i'd be with sue again,1316.559,3.841,1318.4795,0.0,0.0,0.7

it'd be no more hoofing it down the,1320.4,3.2,1322.0,-0.296,-0.20277777777777778,0.4
i began to think of the future,1323.6,3.84,1325.52,0.0,0.0,0.4
which couldn't have been brighter if i'd,1326.0,3.84,1327.92,-0.2924,0.0,0.8
embroidered it with neon lights,1327.44,4.0,1329.44,0.0,0.0,-0.7
it was nice to think of sue shooting to,1329.84,4.0,1331.84,0.4215,0.6,0.7
it's amazing what a full belly can do to,1334.48,3.84,1336.4,0.5859,0.47500000000000003,0.8
i imagination knew what they could do,1345.2,8.64,1349.52,0.0,0.0,0.7
i can't believe that you were in love,1349.6,6.88,1353.04,0.6369,0.5,0.6

mr haskell i'm gonna put up the top,1408.72,4.36,1410.9,0.2023,0.5,0.7
until then i had done things my way,1425.36,3.76,1427.24,0.0,0.0,0.4
but from then on something else stepped,1427.6,2.88,1429.04,0.0,0.0,-0.7
in and shunted me off to a different,1429.12,2.96,1430.6,0.0,0.0,0.2
destination than one i had picked for,1430.48,3.12,1432.04,0.0,0.0,0.4

i'll listen to it,1447.6,2.88,1449.04,0.0,0.0,0.7
but i know what you're going to hand me,1449.279,3.361,1450.9595,0.6486,0.0,-0.7
even before you open your mouth,1450.48,3.12,1452.04,0.0,0.0,0.4
you're going to tell me you don't,1452.64,2.639,1453.9595000000002,0.0,0.0,-0.7
believe my story of how haskell died and,1453.6,3.04,1455.12,-0.5574,0.0,0.3
give me that don't make me laugh,1455.279,5.121,1457.8395,-0.4449,0.3,-0.7
expression on your smug faces,1456.64,3.76,1458.5200000000002,0.2023,0.0,-0.7
i saw it once he was dead,1462.0,3.36,1463.68,-0.6486,-0.2,-0.7
and i was in for it,1463.84,3.36,1465.52,0.0,0.0,0.7
who would believe he fell out of the car,1465.36,3.36,1467.04,0.0,0.0,0.5
fire pascal came to which of course he,1467.2,2.8,1468.6,-0.34,0.0,-0.7
couldn't even he was where i conked him,1468.72,2.8,1470.12,0.0,0.0,-0.7
over the head for his dog,1470.0,4.32,1472.16,0.0,0.0,0.6
yes i was in for it,1471.52,4.399,1473.7195,0.4019,0.0,0.4
instinct told me to run but then i,1474.32,3.2,1475.9199999999998,0.0,0.0,0.7
realized it was hopeless there were lots,1475.919,2.561,1477.1995000000002,-0.4588,0.0,-0.7
of people back down the road who could,1477.52,2.96,1479.0,0.0,-0.07777777777777779,0.3
identify me that gas station guy and the,1478.48,3.679,1480.3195,0.0,0.0,0.3
waitress i would be in the worst spot,1480.48,4.16,1482.56,-0.6249,-1.0,-0.7
then trying to explain why i beat it,1482.159,3.921,1484.1195,0.0,0.0,0.7
the next possibility was to sit tight,1484.64,2.96,1486.12,0.0,-0.08928571428571429,0.3
and tell the truth when the cops came,1486.08,2.959,1487.5594999999998,0.3182,0.0,0.2
but that would be crazy,1487.6,2.88,1489.04,-0.4767,-0.6,0.7
they'd laugh at the truth,1489.039,4.561,1491.3195,0.7096,0.3,-0.7
not have my head in the moose,1490.48,3.12,1492.04,0.0,0.0,-0.7
so what else was it to do but hide the,1494.08,2.959,1495.5594999999998,-0.2617,0.0,-0.7
body and get away in the car,1495.44,3.04,1496.96,0.0,0.0,0.4
i couldn't leave the car there with him,1497.039,3.281,1498.6795,0.0382,0.0,-0.7
in the gully that would be like erecting,1498.48,4.92,1500.94,0.3612,0.0,0.3
a tombstone,1500.32,3.08,1501.86,0.0,0.0,-0.7
my idea was to cover him with brush not,1529.84,3.04,1531.36,0.0,0.0,-0.7
to rob him,1531.76,2.48,1533.0,-0.5574,0.0,0.4
but then i remember that even if i only,1532.88,2.799,1534.2795,0.0,0.0,-0.7
drove the car for 100 miles or so i,1534.24,4.0,1536.24,0.0,0.0,0.2
would need money for gas,1535.679,4.561,1537.9595000000002,0.0,0.0,-0.7
besides it was stupid of me to leave all,1538.24,5.039,1540.7595,-0.5574,-0.7999999999999999,-0.7
that money on a dead man not only that,1540.24,4.4,1542.44,-0.6486,-0.1,-0.7
i'd have to take his driver's license in,1543.279,4.481,1545.5195,0.0,0.0,-0.7
case i was stopped for something,1544.64,3.12,1546.2,-0.2263,0.0,-0.7
i didn't like to think about it but by,1548.08,2.959,1549.5594999999998,-0.1419,0.0,-0.7
that time i'd done just what the police,1549.76,4.48,1552.0,0.0,0.0,0.3
would say i did even if i didn't,1551.039,4.561,1553.3195,0.0,0.0,0.3
my clothes,1554.24,2.64,1555.56,0.0,0.0,0.4

if they found a dead man in the gully,1633.039,5.401,1635.7395,-0.6486,-0.2,0.4
now it would be me,1634.48,3.96,1636.46,0.0,0.0,0.7
as i drove off it was still raining,1644.399,4.721,1646.7595,0.0,0.0,-0.7

i got to some city where i could leave,1836.08,4.4,1838.28,-0.0516,0.0,-0.7

a city i should be safe enough,1851.039,4.64,1853.359,0.4404,0.25,0.7
then after i ditched the car,1853.84,3.92,1855.8,0.0,0.0,-0.7
i could go on to sue,1855.679,4.321,1857.8395,0.0,0.0,-0.7
but those five minutes at the state line,1857.76,4.0,1859.76,0.0,0.0,0.2
made me realize it might be a good idea,1860.0,3.2,1861.6,0.4404,0.7,0.7
to find out a little bit about mr,1861.76,3.039,1863.2795,0.0,-0.1875,0.3
then if anybody asked me questions i,1864.799,3.76,1866.679,0.0,0.0,0.2

the first thing i found out was that i,1868.559,4.321,1870.7195,0.0,0.25,0.2
this was a lot of jack,1872.88,3.12,1874.44,0.0,0.0,-0.5
but believe me,1874.64,2.96,1876.12,0.0,0.0,0.7
it was the kind of money i'd rather not,1876.0,3.84,1877.92,0.0,0.6,0.4
and then i found out from a letter,1885.76,3.6,1887.56,0.0,0.0,-0.7
haskell was cutting around in his bag,1887.12,3.679,1888.9595,-0.128,-0.6,0.4

unbelievable yes it is unbelievable on,2243.64,4.8,2246.04,0.6486,-0.25,0.8
roller skates hmm what balance well I,2246.28,3.86,2248.21,0.2732,0.0,0.4
was known roller skates all afternoon,2248.44,4.44,2250.66,0.0,0.0,0.4
obviously no you never believe what I,2250.14,5.14,2252.71,-0.296,0.0,-0.7
did I broke records huh oh you'd have,2252.88,3.36,2254.56,-0.4215,0.0,0.6

know I try the Swan Dive I missed,2261.4,7.199,2264.9995,-0.296,0.0,-0.7
well no wonder you're worn out finally,2265.3,5.16,2267.88,-0.3182,0.0,-0.7
all of this is very confusing what about,2268.599,3.841,2270.5195000000003,-0.2944,-0.39,-0.7
the formula that's what I was telling,2270.46,3.06,2271.99,0.0,0.0,0.5
oh I'll start at the beginning,2274.72,6.0,2277.72,0.0,0.0,0.4
at 11 52 this morning I took a dose of,2277.9,4.86,2280.33,0.0,0.0,0.2
the formula and in a few minutes I began,2280.72,3.96,2282.7,0.0,-0.2,0.4
to behave exactly like a college boy,2282.76,4.68,2285.1000000000004,0.3612,0.25,0.4
with 20 20 vision and no birth cyclists,2284.68,5.159,2287.2595,-0.0516,0.0,0.2
and plenty of lipstick uh well the,2287.44,3.96,2289.42,0.2732,0.0,-0.7
formula had nothing to do with that I'll,2289.839,3.541,2291.6095,0.0,0.0,0.3
get to that later,2291.4,3.48,2293.14,0.0,0.0,-0.5
we've discovered something that the,2294.88,3.12,2296.44,0.0,0.0,0.4
human race has been searching for since,2296.68,3.659,2298.5095,0.0,0.0,0.4
the beginning of time are you really,2298.0,4.44,2300.22,0.0,0.2,0.4
serious born a bit it works well did I,2300.339,2.881,2301.7795,0.2023,-0.3333333333333333,0.4
because I can't explain the reactions it,2303.22,3.899,2305.1695,0.0,0.0,0.3
seems to work on the mind,2305.26,4.859,2307.6895000000004,0.0,0.0,0.4
and winner imagine people never aging oh,2307.119,5.46,2309.849,0.5859,0.0,0.6
it sounds frightening you mean it it,2310.119,4.98,2312.609,-0.4939,-0.40625,-0.7
really does that well,2312.579,4.02,2314.5890000000004,0.3321,0.2,0.7
because I don't know half of what I'm,2315.099,3.961,2317.0795000000003,0.0,-0.16666666666666666,-0.7
gonna do the dose I took is already worn,2316.599,5.581,2319.3895,-0.296,0.0,-0.7
off I've never seen that was eight hours,2319.06,5.76,2321.94,0.0,0.0,-0.7
uh probably the dose was wrong,2322.18,5.52,2324.94,-0.4767,-0.5,-0.7
obviously hey where you going oh I'm,2324.82,4.44,2327.04,0.0,0.0,0.2
going to try the experiment again but,2327.7,4.82,2330.11,0.0,0.0,0.2
this time with a larger dose,2329.26,3.26,2330.8900000000003,0.0,0.0,0.7
must you make another test oh probably,2344.26,4.56,2346.5400000000004,0.0,0.0,0.2
several I'm glad you're here to see if,2346.78,3.6,2348.5800000000004,0.4588,0.25,0.5
nothing goes wrong this time,2348.82,3.42,2350.53,0.3724,-0.5,0.2
I want you to observe and make notes of,2350.38,4.199,2352.4795,0.0772,0.0,0.8
everything I do knowing me so well,2352.24,3.9,2354.19,0.4101,0.0,0.7
you'll be able to interpret the exact,2354.579,4.52,2356.8390000000004,0.0,0.375,0.4
meaning of my behavior,2356.14,5.219,2358.7495,0.0,0.0,0.3
don't you think you want to change that,2359.099,4.721,2361.4595,0.0772,0.0,-0.7
code and wipe that stuff off your face,2361.359,4.441,2363.5795,0.0,0.0,-0.7
before you try it again oh yes perhaps,2363.82,3.72,2365.6800000000003,0.4019,0.0,0.4
you're right by the way whose lipstick,2365.8,4.08,2367.84,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.2
is it uh what's your name you know oxy,2367.54,3.44,2369.26,0.0,0.0,0.2
Oh you mean that little pin-up girl,2370.98,7.0,2374.48,0.0,-0.25,0.3
cute sort of but half infant,2374.56,6.48,2377.8,0.25,0.16666666666666669,0.4
not perhaps it's visible well she's not,2377.98,4.859,2380.4095,0.2732,0.0,-0.7
Barnaby how much of this stuff you're,2382.839,3.661,2384.6695,0.0,0.2,-0.7
going to take well that's what I thought,2384.82,3.539,2386.5895,0.2732,0.0,0.2
out there I've increased the dose,2386.5,4.2,2388.6,0.2732,0.0,-0.7
seeing that way I'll be,2388.359,4.141,2390.4295,0.0,0.0,0.4
Edwina what are you doing,2390.7,3.96,2392.68,0.0,0.0,-0.7

exactly 100 scientist after you took it,2409.119,4.921,2411.5795000000003,0.0,0.25,0.2
other things became much more,2412.3,4.38,2414.49,0.0,0.1875,0.7
interesting perhaps you're right,2414.04,6.299,2417.1895,0.4019,0.39285714285714285,0.5
oh even the water tastes bitter I did to,2416.68,5.96,2419.66,-0.4215,-0.1,-0.7
Barnaby I'm a little bit frightened I'm,2426.579,5.341,2429.2495000000004,-0.3862,-0.1875,-0.7

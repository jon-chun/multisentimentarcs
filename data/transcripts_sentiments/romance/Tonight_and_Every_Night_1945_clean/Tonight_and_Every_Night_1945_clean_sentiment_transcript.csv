one of us has to remain,2588.3,7.1,2591.8500000000004,0.0,0.0,-0.7
I'm a lonely girl I readily admitted to,2595.78,8.42,2599.99,-0.2732,0.05000000000000002,-0.7
her I was merely patriotic when I signed,2599.56,9.36,2604.24,0.0,-0.5,0.4
and I'm very Frank to say I Did It for,2604.2,8.68,2608.54,0.0,0.2,0.6
the Boy and left behind,2608.92,6.899,2612.3695,0.0,-0.2,0.4
some men in uniform have tried to sway,2612.88,4.199,2614.9795,0.0,0.0,-0.7
failed because he's always on my mind,2617.079,7.221,2620.6895,-0.5106,-0.5,-0.7
and I'm saving most of what they pay me,2620.579,7.981,2624.5695,-0.1027,0.5,-0.7
for the boy I left behind,2624.3,9.299,2628.9495,0.0,-0.2,-0.7
yes he was first in line to enlist,2628.56,8.94,2633.03,0.4019,0.25,0.8
chatting thee for victory,2633.599,7.601,2637.3995,0.0,0.0,0.7
they looked but found the pulse in his,2637.5,9.06,2642.03,0.0,0.0,0.4
wrist so maybe that's why they took me,2641.2,8.639,2645.5195,0.0,0.0,0.3
if they need me then I'm glad to be of,2646.56,4.48,2648.8,0.4588,0.5,0.7
but there's one thing that I wish they,2651.04,4.2,2653.14,0.5499,0.0,-0.5
had defined,2653.44,4.86,2655.87,0.0,0.0,0.4

the boy I left behind,2687.46,6.8,2690.86,0.0,-0.2,0.4

he takes more blood than he gives away,2715.14,9.66,2719.97,0.0,0.5,0.8
so maybe that's why they took me,2719.46,8.74,2723.83,0.0,0.0,0.3
I'm supposed to be content and just keep,2724.8,6.16,2727.88,0.0,0.0,-0.7

The image captures a dramatic scene of a fire engulfing a sign. The sign, which is the central focus of the image, bears the words "THE APOSTLES" and "BETWEEN US". The fire, originating from the bottom right corner of the frame, spreads across the sign in a diagonal path towards the top left corner. The background is shrouded in darkness, with only faint outlines discernible. The entire scene is rendered in black and white, adding to the starkness of the image. The relative position of the fire and the sign suggests a sudden, unexpected event, possibly symbolic or metaphorical in nature.

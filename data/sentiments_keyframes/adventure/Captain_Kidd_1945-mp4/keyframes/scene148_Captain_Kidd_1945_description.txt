This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on the set of a film. The scene unfolds in front of a large ship, its sails billowing in the unseen wind. A group of people are gathered around a wooden staircase, their striped shirts adding a touch of uniformity to the scene. One individual stands out from the rest, holding aloft a large crate emblazoned with the word "Hollandia". The positioning of the characters and objects suggests a narrative unfolding, though the specifics remain unknown. The monochrome palette lends an air of nostalgia to the image, evoking a sense of history and timelessness.

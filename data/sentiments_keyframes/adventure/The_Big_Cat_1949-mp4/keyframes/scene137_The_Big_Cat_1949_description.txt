In the image, there are two men standing in front of a wooden structure with a red roof. The man on the left is wearing a beige cowboy hat and a gray jacket. He has his hands tucked into his pockets and is looking at the other man with a slight smile on his face. The man on the right is dressed in a white shirt and a gray suit, and he is looking back at the first man with a serious expression. The background of the image features a blue sky and trees.

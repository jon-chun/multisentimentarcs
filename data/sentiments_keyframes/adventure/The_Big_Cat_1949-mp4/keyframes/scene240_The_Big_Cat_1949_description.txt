To his right, there are two women engaged in conversation. One woman is dressed in a white dress, while the other is in a blue dress. Their exact actions or expressions are not clearly visible in the image.

The room they're in has wooden furniture, including chairs and a table. The chandelier hanging from the ceiling adds to the ambiance of the scene.

In terms of color, there's a mix of warm tones from the wooden furniture and cool tones from the blue dress of one woman. The green plaid shirt worn by Forrest Gump stands out against this backdrop.

As for body language and gestures, it's difficult to determine specific details without more context or a clearer view of the characters' expressions.

In terms of props and costumes, there are two women dressed in distinct outfits - one in white and the other in blue. Forrest Gump is casually dressed in a green plaid shirt.

The depth of field isn't clearly visible in this image as it's not possible to determine the distance between the camera and the subjects.

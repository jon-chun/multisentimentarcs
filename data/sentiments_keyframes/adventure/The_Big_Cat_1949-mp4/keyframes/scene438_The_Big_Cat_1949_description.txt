The setting is a lush green forest, providing a stark contrast to the dirt path that Forrest Gump is walking on. The color palette is dominated by earth tones, with splashes of green from the trees and brown from the path. Forrest Gump's body language and gestures suggest he is in motion, further emphasized by his position in the center of the frame. There are no props or costumes visible in this shot. The depth of field is shallow, with the background blurred, which helps to isolate Forrest Gump as the main subject of the image.

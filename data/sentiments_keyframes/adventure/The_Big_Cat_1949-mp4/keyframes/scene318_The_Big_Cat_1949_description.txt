In the image, there are two men in a room with a window. The man on the left is wearing a blue shirt and has dark hair. He is looking at the other man who is standing to his right. This second man is dressed in a white shirt and also has dark hair. He is holding a cup of coffee in his hand. The room they are in has a wooden floor and a window with curtains. The lighting in the room is dim, creating an atmosphere that suggests it might be evening or night outside. The positioning of the men and their interaction seems to indicate a conversation or discussion taking place between them.

In the image, there are two men in a room with wooden paneling. The man on the left is wearing a white suit and a black bowtie, and he is looking at the other man who is sitting down. The man on the right is wearing a pink shirt and has his head tilted to the side as he looks up at the standing man. In the background, there's a wooden cabinet with a mirror hanging above it. On the table in front of them, there are two bottles - one clear and one green. The room gives off a warm and inviting atmosphere.

The image presents a striking logo for a film production company named "Olive Films". The logo is set against a stark black background, creating a strong contrast that draws attention to its elements. Dominating the center of the logo is a stylized eye, rendered in shades of yellow and white. This eye is not just a simple shape; it's intricately designed with two eyelashes and a pupil, giving it a sense of depth and realism.

The company name "Olive Films" is written in bold, white letters beneath the eye. The choice of font and color for the text ensures that it stands out against the black background, reinforcing the brand identity.

In addition to these elements, there's also a subtle hint of the company's focus on film production. A small camera icon is subtly placed next to the word "Films", suggesting the company's involvement in the film industry. The overall design of the logo, with its use of color and typography, conveys a sense of professionalism and dedication to quality filmmaking.

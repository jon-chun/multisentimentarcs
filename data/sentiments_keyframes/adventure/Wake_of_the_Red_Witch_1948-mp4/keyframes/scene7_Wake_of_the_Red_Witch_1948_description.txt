The image is a movie poster for the film "Howards End". The background of the poster is black, providing a stark contrast to the white text that lists the names of the film's special effects. The text is arranged in a grid format with three columns and four rows. Each name is written in all caps and is centered within its respective column.

The first row features the names "Film Editor", "Richard L. Van Enger", and "Special Effects". The second row lists the names of the film's set decorators, makeup supervisors, hair stylists, and sound system operators. The third row includes the names of the film's visual effects artists and post-processing artists.

The poster also includes a copyright symbol followed by the year 2013, indicating the copyright holder's rights over the image. The overall layout is simple yet effective, with the white text standing out against the black background to draw attention to the names listed. The poster does not include any images or other visual elements beyond the text.

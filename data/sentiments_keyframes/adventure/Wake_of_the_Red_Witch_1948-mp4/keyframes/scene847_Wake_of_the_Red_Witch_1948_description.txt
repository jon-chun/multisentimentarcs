Behind her, Dmitri Desgoffe-und-Taxis is seen walking away from the camera. He is wearing a black suit and carries a briefcase in his hand. The setting appears to be a park or garden, with trees and bushes visible in the background. The colors in the image are predominantly green and brown, with Agatha's black uniform providing a stark contrast.

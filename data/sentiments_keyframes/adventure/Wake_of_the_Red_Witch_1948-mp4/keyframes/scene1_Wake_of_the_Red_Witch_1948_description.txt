The image presents a striking logo for a film production company named "Olive Films". The logo is set against a stark black background, creating a strong contrast that draws attention to its elements. Dominating the center of the logo is a white fish, its body oriented towards the right side of the image. The fish's mouth is slightly open, as if caught mid-breath or in the middle of a song.

The company name "Olive Films" is prominently displayed beneath the fish. The text is written in all capital letters and is colored in white, matching the color of the fish above it. The positioning of the text directly under the fish creates a balanced composition within the logo.

Overall, the logo uses simple yet effective design elements to convey its message. The use of a fish as the central figure could suggest themes of aquatic or marine life, while the choice of white for both the fish and the text ensures that the logo stands out against the black background. The open mouth of the fish adds a dynamic element to the otherwise static image.

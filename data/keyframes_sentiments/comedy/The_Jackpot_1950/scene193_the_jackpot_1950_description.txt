This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The main focus of the image is a man in a suit, who is walking away from the camera. He is positioned on the right side of the frame, moving towards the left. His posture suggests he is in motion, perhaps heading to an important meeting or returning home after a long day.

On the left side of the frame, there's a woman standing still, looking at the man as he walks by. She appears to be observing him, possibly waiting for someone or simply enjoying the city life around her.

The background of the image reveals more about the setting - it's a bustling city street lined with shops and buildings. The presence of these elements suggests that this scene takes place in a commercial area during daytime.

Please note that as this is a black and white photograph, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the varying shades of gray provide depth and contrast to the image, enhancing its visual appeal.

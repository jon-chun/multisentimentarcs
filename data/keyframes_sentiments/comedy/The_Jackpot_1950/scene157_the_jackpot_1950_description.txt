This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in a store. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and hat, is holding a bottle of beer. His gaze is directed towards the man on the right, who is also wearing a suit and tie. The store behind them has a sign that reads "OSBOORN'S STORE". The image evokes a sense of camaraderie and casual conversation between the two men in an everyday setting.

The image is a black and white still from the movie "A Streetcar Named Desire" featuring Marlon Brando as the character Blanche Du Bois. The scene takes place in a living room, with Blanche standing in the foreground on the left side of the frame. She is holding a phone to her ear, her mouth open as if she is shouting into it. Behind her, on the right side of the frame, is her sister Stella Artois played by Vivien Leigh. Stella is sitting on a couch, looking at Blanche with a concerned expression. The room is dimly lit, adding to the dramatic atmosphere of the scene.

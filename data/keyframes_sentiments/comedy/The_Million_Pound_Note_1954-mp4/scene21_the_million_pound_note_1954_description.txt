On this balcony, two individuals are present. One person is standing, while the other is seated. Both are dressed in black clothing, which contrasts sharply with the white background of the building. Their attire suggests a formal or professional setting.

The photo is taken from a low angle, looking up at the people on the balcony. This perspective emphasizes the height of the building and gives the viewer a sense of being in the scene.

The lighting in the image is natural, suggesting it was taken during the day. The absence of shadows indicates that the sun might be directly overhead or to one side.

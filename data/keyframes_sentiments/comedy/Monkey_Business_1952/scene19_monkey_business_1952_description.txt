The image is a black and white still from the movie "Some Like It Hot". The scene takes place in a kitchen. On the left, we see Tony Curtis, dressed in a white shirt, suspenders, and a bowler hat, holding a frying pan. On the right, Marilyn Monroe is seen wearing a white dress with a pearl necklace, standing at the counter. The image captures a moment of interaction between the two characters, set against the backdrop of a typical kitchen. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene.

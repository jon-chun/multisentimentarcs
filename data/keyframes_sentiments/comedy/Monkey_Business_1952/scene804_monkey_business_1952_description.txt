This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals on a sidewalk. The man, positioned to the left of the woman, is dressed in a suit and tie, while the woman, standing to his right, is wearing a dress. They are walking away from the camera, their figures framed by the railing of a building behind them. A car parked further down the street can be seen in the background. The image evokes a sense of nostalgia and longing, amplified by the black and white color scheme and the couple's distant gaze.

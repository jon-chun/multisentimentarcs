The room itself is dimly lit, creating an atmosphere of quiet introspection. A wooden bench and a bookshelf can be seen in the background, further enhancing the homely and personal setting. The monochrome color scheme adds a timeless quality to the photograph, focusing the viewer's attention on the man and his actions rather than on colors or details.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a room. The primary focus of the image is a wooden dresser, which stands against a wall adorned with a mirror. On top of the dresser, there are two lamps casting light onto the surface below. 

A woman, dressed in a long-sleeved shirt and pants, is seen walking past the dresser. Her movement suggests she is passing through the room rather than interacting with the objects within it. The positioning of the woman and her attire suggest a sense of formality or perhaps an older time period.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman and the mirror on the wall. This perspective adds a sense of depth to the image and draws attention to the woman's figure against the backdrop of the room.

In terms of lighting, the lamps on the dresser are the primary source of illumination, casting shadows that add contrast and texture to the scene. The mirror on the wall reflects light, further enhancing the interplay of light and shadow in the photograph.

The composition of the image is balanced with the woman's figure centrally positioned and the dresser serving as a focal point. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, evoking a sense of nostalgia or history.

Overall, the film-maker has used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, costumes, depth of field, character positioning, visual effects, and post-processing to create a compelling and visually engaging scene.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a room with a window. The room is furnished with chairs, tables, and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling. 

In the center of the frame, a man dressed in a suit is standing on a table. He is holding a gun in his hand and appears to be pointing it at another man who is seated at the table. This seated man is wearing a tie and seems to be looking up at the standing man.

To the left of the standing man, there's another man who is also dressed in a suit. He is standing next to the seated man and is holding a briefcase in his hand.

The room itself has a window with blinds partially drawn, allowing some light to filter into the room. The chandelier hanging from the ceiling adds an element of grandeur to the scene.

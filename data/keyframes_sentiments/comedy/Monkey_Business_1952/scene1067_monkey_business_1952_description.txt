This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of solitude in an outdoor setting. The main subject is a woman, dressed in a striped shirt and shorts, standing on a stone patio. She is positioned in front of a door, which features a window above it. 

The woman's body language suggests she is in the process of opening the door, as indicated by her reaching towards it with one hand while holding onto a purse with the other. The patio where she stands is made of stone and extends to include a round table accompanied by two chairs nearby.

The background of the image reveals a house constructed from brick, complete with a chimney. A tree can be seen in the distance, adding to the serene ambiance of the scene. Despite being a black and white image, it's rich in detail and evokes a sense of tranquility.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a room. The main subject of the image is a man, who is dressed in a white lab coat and tie. He is standing near a bookshelf that is filled with various books. The man appears to be deep in thought as he is seen smoking a cigarette.

The camera angle of the photo is from a low angle, looking up at the man, which gives him an imposing presence. The lighting in the room is dim, adding to the dramatic effect of the image. The background features a window with blinds partially drawn, suggesting it might be daytime outside.

In terms of composition, the man is positioned slightly off-center, drawing attention to his contemplative expression and the action of smoking the cigarette. The bookshelf behind him adds depth to the image, while also hinting at the intellectual nature of the man's profession.

The black and white color scheme enhances the dramatic effect of the photograph, focusing the viewer's attention on the subject and his actions rather than being distracted by colors. The man's body language and gestures, particularly his thoughtful expression and the act of smoking a cigarette, convey a sense of introspection and deep thought.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and composition to create a powerful and evocative image. The use of black and white further enhances the dramatic effect of the photograph, making it a compelling piece of visual storytelling.

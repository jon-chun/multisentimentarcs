This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a store. The main subject of the image is a man, who is standing on the right side of the frame. He is dressed in a striped shirt and pants, and he's holding a bag in his hand. His gaze is directed towards the left side of the frame, suggesting that his attention has been caught by something or someone outside the frame.

The store itself has a counter with shelves behind it, filled with various items for sale. The lighting in the image is dim, adding to the overall mood of the scene. Despite being a black and white photo, the contrast between light and dark areas provides depth and texture to the image.

Please note that as this is a black and white photograph, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the varying shades of gray create a rich tapestry of tones throughout the image. The man's striped shirt stands out due to its pattern, but other than that, no other distinct colors can be identified from the image description provided.

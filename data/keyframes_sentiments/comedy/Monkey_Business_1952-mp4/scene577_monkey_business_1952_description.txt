On the other hand, the passenger on the right is looking down at the dashboard with a frown. The car's interior and the background are blurred, drawing focus to the two individuals in the foreground. The overall composition of the image suggests a narrative open to interpretation, possibly hinting at a conversation or an event unfolding within the vehicle.

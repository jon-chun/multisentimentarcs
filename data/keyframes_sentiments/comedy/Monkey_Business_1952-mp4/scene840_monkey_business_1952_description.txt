This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a street. The main subjects are two men, one standing in the foreground with his back to the camera, and another man sitting in a car in the background. 

The man standing in the foreground is dressed in a suit and tie, suggesting a formal or professional setting. He stands in front of a tree, which provides a natural element to the urban scene.

In contrast, the man sitting in the car in the background appears more relaxed, wearing a hat and holding a camera, possibly indicating that he is a photographer or journalist.

The street they are on has buildings visible in the background, adding depth to the image. A car parked further down the street can also be seen.

Overall, this photograph captures an interesting contrast between formal and casual settings, with its subjects engaged in different activities within the same urban landscape.

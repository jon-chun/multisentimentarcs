This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The scene is set in the early 20th century, as indicated by the clothing style of the people present.

In the foreground, there are two men standing near a car. One man is dressed in a suit and hat, while the other is wearing a suit with a bowler hat. Their body language suggests they are engaged in conversation.

A woman is also present in the scene, walking away from the group of men. She is carrying a parasol, which was a common accessory during that period.

The background of the image reveals more about the setting. There's a building visible, and another car can be seen further down the street. The photograph appears to have been taken during daylight hours.

Please note that as this is a black and white image, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the contrast between light and dark areas provides depth to the scene.

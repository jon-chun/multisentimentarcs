The image is a black and white movie poster for the film "Warner Electric". The poster prominently features a list of names, presumably representing key contributors to the film. These names are arranged in a grid format, with each name appearing below the other. The text is white, standing out against the black background of the poster.

The poster also includes an image of a man's face, which is located at the bottom left corner. This image is surrounded by text that reads "Art Direction", "Lyle Wheeler - George Patrick Set Decorations", "Thomas Little - Walter M. Scott", "William B. Murphy", "Charles LeMaire", "Trevithick", "Earle Haden", "Ben Nye", and "Ray Kellogg". This suggests that these individuals were involved in the art direction, set decorations, and other aspects of the film's production.

The overall layout of the poster is simple and straightforward, with the names and images arranged in a clear and easy-to-read manner. The use of black and white gives the poster a classic and timeless feel, which may be fitting for a film titled "Warner Electric".

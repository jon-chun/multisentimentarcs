In the image, we see the renowned actress Katharine Hepburn, embodying her iconic character, Rosemary Woodruff. She is captured in a moment of surprise or shock, as indicated by her raised hands and wide-eyed expression. Dressed in a black suit and tie, she stands out against the backdrop of a room filled with bookshelves and furniture. The monochrome palette of the image adds to its dramatic effect.

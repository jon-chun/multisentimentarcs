This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between three individuals in front of a building. The man on the left, clad in a suit, stands slightly behind the woman on the right, who is dressed in a dress. A third person, also wearing a suit, is positioned between them. The man on the left is looking towards the camera with a slight smile, while the woman on the right appears to be looking away from it. The building behind them has a sign that reads "SALON". The photograph evokes a sense of nostalgia and simplicity, emphasized by its black and white color scheme.

The car they are in appears to be parked, as there are no visible signs of motion or movement outside the window. The background is blurred, drawing focus to the characters and their interaction within the car.

The lighting in the image is diffused, creating a soft contrast between the light and dark areas. This gives the photograph a timeless quality, emphasizing the emotions over the details.

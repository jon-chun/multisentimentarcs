This is a black and white photograph capturing a scene from the 1968 film "Planet of the Apes". The central figure in the image is the character known as "Ufo", portrayed by actor Roddy McDowell. Ufo is seated at a desk within a laboratory setting, his arms crossed over his chest in a defensive or contemplative posture. He is dressed in a white lab coat adorned with black stripes and the number 5 prominently displayed on the front. In his right hand, he holds a glass beaker, suggesting some form of experiment or analysis might be underway.

The desk before him is cluttered with various pieces of laboratory equipment, including test tubes and microscopes, indicating a scientific environment. The background features a window and a door, providing context to the indoor setting. Despite being a black and white image, the contrast between light and dark areas provides depth and detail to the scene.

The photograph's composition places Ufo in the center of the frame, drawing attention to his actions and expressions. His facial expression is serious, perhaps indicative of the gravity of his work or the critical nature of his experiment. The camera angle and lighting contribute to a sense of realism, further enhancing the impact of this still from the film "Planet of the Apes".

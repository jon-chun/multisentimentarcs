This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in a room. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and tie, is seated next to the man on the right, who is wearing a shirt and tie. They are positioned behind a table that holds a chair with the number 3 emblazoned on it. A stuffed animal, also bearing the number 3, is perched atop the chair. The room they're in features a window and a radiator, adding to the ambiance of the scene. The monochrome palette lends a timeless quality to this snapshot of interaction between the two men.

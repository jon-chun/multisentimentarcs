In the foreground, we see a car interior where two characters are seated. On the left side of the frame, there's a woman with blonde hair, dressed in a white dress. She is looking out of the window, her gaze directed towards something outside the frame. 

On the right side of the frame, there's a man wearing a gray suit. He is looking directly at the camera, his expression neutral. The car they are in is parked on the street, and the Space Needle can be seen towering over them in the background.

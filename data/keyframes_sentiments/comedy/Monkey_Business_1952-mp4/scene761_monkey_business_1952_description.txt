This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Wizard of Oz". The scene takes place in a room with curtains, giving it an indoor setting. 

In the foreground, there's a man dressed in a striped shirt and glasses. He stands on the left side of the frame, holding a bag of popcorn in his hand. His posture is relaxed, suggesting he might be enjoying a casual day out.

On the right side of the frame, a woman is seen wearing a white dress adorned with ruffles. She holds a fan in her hand and appears to be waving at the man. Her body language suggests she's engaging in conversation or perhaps greeting him warmly.

The relative positions of the man and woman, along with their actions, create an interesting dynamic between them. The popcorn bag held by the man and the fan carried by the woman add unique elements to the scene, hinting at a story beyond what's immediately visible in this still image.

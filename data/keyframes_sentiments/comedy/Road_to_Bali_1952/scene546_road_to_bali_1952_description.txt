The image presents a striking contrast between the background and the text. The background is a deep, dark blue, reminiscent of a night sky or perhaps an ocean depth. This backdrop serves to highlight the white text that reads "RETROSPECTIVE" in all capital letters.

The text itself is positioned centrally on the image, drawing the viewer's attention immediately. Its stark white color stands out against the dark background, making it the focal point of the image. The simplicity of the composition allows for a clear and unambiguous interpretation: the image is a representation of a "RETROSPECTIVE" theme.

In terms of object count, there are two primary objects in this image: the text and the background. The text is static, while the background remains constant throughout the image. There are no discernible actions or movements within the image, as it is a still image with no implied motion.

The relative position of the objects is straightforward: the text is centrally located on the image, with equal space above and below it. This positioning further emphasizes the importance of the text in this composition.

Overall, the image uses color contrast, object count, and relative positions to create a simple yet effective representation of a "RETROSPECTIVE" theme.

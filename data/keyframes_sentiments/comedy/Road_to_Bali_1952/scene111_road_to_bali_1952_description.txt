Each statue is adorned with a headdress and holds a staff, signifying some form of authority or status. Their facial expressions vary, adding to the dynamic nature of the scene. The first statue on the left exudes a calm demeanor, while the second one in the middle appears to be in a state of contemplation. The third statue on the right seems to be in a moment of intense emotion.

The background is dark and out of focus, which further accentuates the statues and draws attention to their intricate details. The lighting is dramatic, with the spotlight shining directly on the central statue, creating a halo effect that adds to the overall mystique of the scene.

In terms of color, the golden hue of the statues stands out against the dark background, making them the focal point of the image. The body language and gestures of the statues are also noteworthy, as they seem to be in motion, further enhancing the dynamic nature of the scene.

The props and costumes used for the statues are realistic and detailed, adding to the authenticity of the scene. The depth of field is shallow, with the statues sharply in focus while the background is blurred, which adds a sense of three-dimensionality to the image.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expressions, camera angles, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, gestures, props, costumes, depth of field, character positioning, and visual effects to create a captivating and dynamic scene.

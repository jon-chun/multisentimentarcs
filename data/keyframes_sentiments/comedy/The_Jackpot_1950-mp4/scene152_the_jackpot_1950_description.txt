This is a black and white movie still from the film "Double Indemnity". The image captures a tense moment between two characters, Phyllis Dietrich (the woman) and Fred MacMurray (the man), in a living room setting. 

Phyllis Dietrich, dressed in a plaid dress, is seated on a couch with her legs crossed. She has a serious expression on her face as she looks at Fred MacMurray. Her body language suggests she is in control of the situation.

Fred MacMurray, wearing a suit and tie, is standing in front of the couch. He also has a serious expression on his face as he looks back at Phyllis Dietrich. His posture indicates that he is being addressed by her.

The living room setting includes a lamp, a bookshelf, and a window with curtains. The window allows some light to enter the room, creating a contrast between the lit and unlit areas of the scene. The positioning of the characters and their expressions suggest an intense conversation or negotiation taking place.

Please note that as this is a black and white image, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the use of shading and contrast adds depth to the image, highlighting the characters and their expressions.

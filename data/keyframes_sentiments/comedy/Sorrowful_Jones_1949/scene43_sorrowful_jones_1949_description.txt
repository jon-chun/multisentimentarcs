This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a living room. The main subject of the image is a woman, who is standing on a wooden floor with a striped rug. She is dressed in a long-sleeved dress and holds a fan in her hand.

The room itself is furnished with a couch that has a striped cushion. A coffee table sits in front of the couch, adorned with a plant and a lamp. The walls of the room are painted white, providing a stark contrast to the black and white tones of the photograph.

In the background, there's a window with curtains drawn closed. On the windowsill, another plant can be seen, mirroring the one on the coffee table. The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of tranquility and elegance.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a tender moment between a young girl and an older man, who are both sitting on a horse. The girl, dressed in a white blouse and a dark skirt, is petting the horse's nose with her right hand. The man, wearing a plaid shirt and a hat, has his arm around the girl's waist. The background features a wooden fence and a tree. The photograph evokes feelings of nostalgia and warmth.

The image captures a moment in black and white, adding a timeless quality to the scene. At the center of the frame is an older man, dressed in a suit and hat, engaged in conversation on a telephone. His facial expression is serious, suggesting that the call might be of importance or concern.

The camera angle is low, looking up at the man, which gives him an imposing presence and emphasizes his role as the main subject of the image. The lighting is dramatic, with light shining down on the man from above, casting shadows around him and highlighting his features.

The background is blurred, drawing focus to the man in the foreground. However, it's discernible that the setting appears to be a store or shop, possibly a newsstand given the presence of newspapers visible in the distance.

The monochrome palette enhances the mood of the image, evoking feelings of nostalgia and simplicity. The absence of color allows for a focus on the textures and contrasts within the scene, from the man's suit to the grain of the newspapers.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and visual effects to create a powerful and evocative image.

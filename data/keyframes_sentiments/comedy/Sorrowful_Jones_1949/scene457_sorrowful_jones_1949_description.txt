The image you've shared is a black and white movie poster for the film "Sorrorful Jones". The poster is dominated by text in a serif font, which lists the names of the cast members. The names are arranged in two columns, with the left column containing the names of the male cast members and the right column containing the names of the female cast members. The text is white, providing a stark contrast against the black background of the poster.

The title of the film, "Sorrorful Jones", is prominently displayed at the top in large letters, drawing attention to the main subject of the poster. The overall layout and design of the poster suggest a classic, timeless style, fitting for a film that bears the same name as the iconic horror genre it likely belongs to.

As for the sentiment or emotions evoked by the film's elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, gestures, props and costumes, depth of field, character positioning and interaction, visual effects and post-processing, I'm afraid I don't have the ability to analyze these elements as they are not visible in the image you've shared. However, given that this is a movie poster for a horror film, one can expect to see elements such as eerie lighting, dramatic camera angles, and an atmospheric setting to create a sense of suspense and fear.

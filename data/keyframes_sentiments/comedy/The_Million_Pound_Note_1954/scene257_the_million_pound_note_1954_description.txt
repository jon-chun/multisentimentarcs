Forrest Gump, dressed in a black suit and a white rose pinned to his lapel, stands to the left of the frame. His gaze is directed towards something outside the frame, suggesting he might be lost in thought or observing an event happening off-camera.

On the right side of the frame, Lieutenant Dan Johnson is seen wearing a black shirt and a blue tie. He too seems to be looking out through the window, his attention focused on something beyond the frame.

The image is taken from a low angle, making the characters appear larger than life. This perspective adds a sense of grandeur to the scene and emphasizes the importance of the characters in this moment.

The lighting in the image is soft and diffused, casting a warm glow over the scene. The colors are muted, with the white building and pink flowers providing a contrast against the black suits of the characters.

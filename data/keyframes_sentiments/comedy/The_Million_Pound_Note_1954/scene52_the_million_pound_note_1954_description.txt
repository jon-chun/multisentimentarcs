The image presents a vivid scene of a meal preparation. At the center of the frame is a metal tray, filled with raw meat and vegetables, ready to be cooked. The meat, sliced into thin strips, has a rich red color that contrasts with the vibrant green of the vegetables. 

Scattered around the tray are cherry tomatoes, their bright red hue adding a pop of color to the scene. A few cloves of garlic lie nearby, their papery skins catching the light. 

The tray is placed on a table covered with a white tablecloth, providing a neutral backdrop that allows the colors of the food to stand out. In the background, a green curtain hangs, its color echoing that of the vegetables and adding depth to the image.

The overall composition suggests an atmosphere of anticipation for a delicious meal to come. The precise placement of each element in the frame creates a balanced and visually appealing scene.

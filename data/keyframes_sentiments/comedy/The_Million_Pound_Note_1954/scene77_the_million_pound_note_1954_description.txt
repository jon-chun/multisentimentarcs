The letter, dated June 1955, is addressed to "Dear Sir" and offers a loan of Â£1,000,000 for the purchase of a one million pound foundation in London. The letterhead of the Bank of England is visible at the top of the letter. The person holding the letter has their thumb on the right side of the letter and their fingers on the left side.

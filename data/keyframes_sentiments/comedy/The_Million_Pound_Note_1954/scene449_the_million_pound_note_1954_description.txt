The image captures a moment of solemnity and importance. A hand, appearing from the right side of the frame, holds a piece of paper that is white with black text. The text on the paper reads "Bank & England One Million Pounds Ten Shillings". The background is dark and out of focus, drawing attention to the hand and the paper it holds. The overall composition suggests a significant event or transaction involving 1 million pounds sterling.

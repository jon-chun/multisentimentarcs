In the image, there is a woman dressed in a brown dress with white trim and a fur stole. She is wearing a pearl necklace and has a feathered hat on her head. The woman is standing behind a table that holds a vase filled with flowers and a teapot. 

On the other side of the table, there are two children dressed in blue dresses. They are looking at the woman with expressions of surprise or curiosity. The setting appears to be an outdoor garden, with a building visible in the background.

The image captures a moment that seems to be from a film or television show, given the formal attire and the presence of props like the teapot and vase. The woman's facial expression suggests she is making a statement or performing for the children, while their surprised expressions indicate they are reacting to something unexpected or interesting.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in front of a taxi cab. The man on the left, dressed in a gray sweater, is holding a cigarette in his right hand. He is looking at the other man who is wearing a light blue uniform with "Yellow Cab" written on it. This man is also holding a cigarette in his right hand and is looking back at the first man. The taxi cab behind them has a sign that reads "Taxi Co." The photograph evokes a sense of camaraderie and shared experience between the two men, as they both engage with each other while smoking their cigarettes.

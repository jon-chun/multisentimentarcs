This is a black and white movie still from the film "Double Indemnity". The image captures a moment between two characters, Phyllis Dietrich (played by Barbara Stanwyck) and Sam Fuller (played by Fred MacMurray), in a room adorned with wallpaper featuring a floral pattern. 

Phyllis Dietrich, dressed in a green dress, is standing on the left side of the frame. She is holding a black purse in her hand and appears to be engaged in conversation with Sam Fuller. Sam Fuller, wearing a gray suit and tie, is positioned on the right side of the image. He is holding a newspaper in his hand and looking at Phyllis Dietrich.

The room they are in has a staircase visible on the left side of the frame. The wallpaper covering the walls adds a touch of elegance to the scene. Despite being a still image, it conveys a sense of dialogue and interaction between the two characters.

The image is a black and white movie still featuring two individuals in a room. The person on the left, dressed in a gray suit with a white shirt and a black tie, stands behind the person on the right, who is wearing a white blouse. They are positioned in front of a staircase that leads to an unseen upper level. The room they are in has a window on the left side, allowing light to filter into the space. A lamp can be seen on the right side of the image, adding to the ambiance of the scene. The overall composition and lighting suggest a sense of depth and perspective in the photograph.

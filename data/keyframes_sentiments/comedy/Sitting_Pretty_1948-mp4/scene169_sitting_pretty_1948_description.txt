This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in what appears to be a garden setting. The person on the left, clad in a checkered dress, stands with their hands clasped together in front of them. On the right, another individual is seated, donning a suit and tie, with a briefcase resting on their lap. Their expressions are serious, suggesting an intense conversation or moment between them. The garden setting forms the backdrop of this scene, complete with trees and a house visible in the distance. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to the photograph.

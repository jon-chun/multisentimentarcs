In the black and white photo, a woman is seated on a wooden chair in what appears to be an outdoor setting. She is dressed in a patterned blouse and holds a cigarette in her hand. The camera angle is from the side, capturing her profile. The lighting is diffused, casting soft shadows and highlighting the texture of her blouse. The background features a brick wall with a window, adding depth to the scene. The woman's body language suggests she is relaxed or contemplative. The props and costumes are simple yet effective in conveying the character and setting. The overall composition creates a sense of tranquility and introspection.

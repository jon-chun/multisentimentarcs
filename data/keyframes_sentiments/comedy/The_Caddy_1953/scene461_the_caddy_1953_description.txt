The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment at Mama Anthony's spaghetti dinners. The main focus of the image is a sign, which is attached to a fence with two nails. The sign is rectangular in shape and has a wooden frame. It features text in a mix of cursive and block letters, indicating that the event is "direct from Monterey riot in person Joe Anthony and Harvey Miller". This suggests that the event is taking place at Mama Anthony's restaurant, possibly due to some sort of riot or disturbance in Monterey. The sign also mentions it's the third week, which could imply that this is a recurring event or part of an ongoing series. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, evoking a sense of nostalgia.

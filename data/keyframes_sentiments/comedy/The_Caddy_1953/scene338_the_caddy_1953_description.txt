This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Sunrise". The image features three individuals standing in front of a building. 

The person on the left, dressed in a suit, has dark hair and is smiling at the camera. In the middle, there's another individual wearing a dress with a floral pattern. This person has blonde hair and is looking off to the side with a neutral expression. On the right, the third person is seen wearing a white jacket and has red hair. They are also looking off to the side but their facial expression is not visible in this shot.

The building behind them has windows and a door, suggesting it might be an office or residential building. The overall composition of the image suggests a casual yet formal setting, possibly indicating a significant event or occasion.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in a room. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and tie, holds a book titled "The Great Gatsby" in his hands. His counterpart on the right, clad in a polka dot robe, stands by his side. They are positioned against a backdrop of a wall adorned with a window and a plant. The room is illuminated by natural light filtering through the window. The overall composition of the image suggests a quiet, introspective moment between the two characters.

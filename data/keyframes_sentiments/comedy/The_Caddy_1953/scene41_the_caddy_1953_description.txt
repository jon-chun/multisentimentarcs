The composition of the image places the man in the center, drawing the viewer's attention directly to him. His position and the angle of the shot create a dynamic interplay between the subject and his surroundings.

There are no discernible texts or countable objects in the image. The relative positions of the objects remain constant with the man as the central figure, the trees and bushes forming the backdrop, and the shadow cast on the ground below him.

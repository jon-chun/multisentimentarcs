This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in a room. The man on the left, clad in a houndstooth suit, stands slightly behind his companion. His gaze is directed towards the camera, suggesting he might be the subject of focus for this image. 

On the right, another man is seen wearing a dark suit and tie. He holds a small object in his hand, which could possibly be a cigarette or cigar. His attention seems to be elsewhere, away from the camera.

The room they are in has a window visible in the background, adding depth to the scene. The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of camaraderie and shared experience between the two men.

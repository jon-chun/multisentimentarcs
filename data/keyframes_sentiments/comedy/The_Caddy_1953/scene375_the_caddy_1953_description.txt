The image presents a close-up view of the top left corner of a leather baseball cap. The cap is adorned with a rectangular white label that prominently displays the text "PRESENTED TO HARVEY MILLER SR. SEPT. 18, 1943 PROFESSIONAL GOLFERS ASSOCIATION". This suggests that the cap was given to Harvey Miller Sr. in September 1943 by the Professional Golfers Association. The cap's leather texture and the white label contrast sharply, making the text easily readable. The image captures a moment of stillness, with no actions or movements depicted. The focus is solely on the cap and its label, providing a glimpse into a piece of history associated with professional golfing.

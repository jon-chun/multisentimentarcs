In the black and white photograph, a woman is seated in the driver's seat of a car. She is dressed in a light-colored jacket and has her hands resting on the steering wheel. The car is parked in front of a building with a window visible in the background. A palm tree can also be seen behind the car. The photo captures the scene from a low angle, looking up at the woman. The composition of the image places the woman as the central focus, with the building and palm tree providing context to her location. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image.

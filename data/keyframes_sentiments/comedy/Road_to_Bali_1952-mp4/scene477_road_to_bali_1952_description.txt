The image captures a scene from the movie "Aladdin", featuring three characters: Jafar, Rajah, and Iago. They are standing in front of a stone pillar with a lantern hanging from it. The character on the left is Jafar, distinguishable by his red and white striped outfit. In the middle, we see Rajah, who is wearing a blue and gold outfit. On the right, there's Iago, donned in a brown and orange outfit. The characters are positioned such that they form an arc around the stone pillar, with Jafar on one side, Rajah at the center, and Iago on the other side. The lantern hanging from the pillar adds a touch of warmth to the scene. The image does not contain any text or other discernible details.

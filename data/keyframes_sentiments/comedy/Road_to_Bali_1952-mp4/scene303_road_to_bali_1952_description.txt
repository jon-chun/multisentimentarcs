On the right side of the frame, Thomas Mitchell is dressed in a black shirt and pants. He too seems to be part of the conversation, his posture relaxed yet attentive.

The background features a desert landscape with palm trees scattered around, adding to the overall setting of the scene. The color palette of the image is dominated by earth tones, with the blue of Gary Cooper's shirt providing a striking contrast.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of tension and anticipation, characteristic of the "High Noon" genre. The characters' expressions and body language, along with the desert setting, create an atmosphere that draws the viewer into the scene.

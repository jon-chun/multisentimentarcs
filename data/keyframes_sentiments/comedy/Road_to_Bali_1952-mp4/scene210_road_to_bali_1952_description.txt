This image captures a scene from the movie "The Right Stuff" featuring actors Glennon Hiburdman and Scott Glenn. The setting is a beach, with palm trees swaying in the background under a clear blue sky. Glennon Hiburdman, dressed in a white astronaut suit complete with gloves and helmet, is seated on a bench. His posture suggests he's in deep thought or perhaps preparing for an upcoming mission. Standing next to him is Scott Glenn, clad in a blue shirt and khaki pants, holding a camera. His stance indicates he might be documenting Glennon's preparations or the events unfolding around them. The overall composition of the image suggests a moment of calm before the storm of action that space exploration often entails.

The image is a movie poster for the film "New Songs". The background of the poster is black, and it features white text. The title of the film, "New Songs", is prominently displayed at the top of the poster in large letters. Below the title, there are two names listed: Johnny Burke and James Van Heusen. These names are presumably the composers or writers of the songs featured in the film.

The bottom of the poster features a small white border with a black zigzag pattern along its edges. This border frames the text above it, drawing attention to the title and the names of the songwriters.

Overall, the poster is simple yet effective, using contrast between the black background and white text to make the information stand out. The use of a single color scheme gives the poster a unified look, while the zigzag pattern on the border adds an element of visual interest. The text is clear and easy to read, ensuring that the viewer can quickly identify the title of the film and the names of the songwriters.

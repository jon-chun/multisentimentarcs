The image is a black and white movie still from the film "The Hard Goodbye" featuring actors Robert De Niro, Woody Harrelson, and Christopher Walken. The scene takes place on a boat with the three characters standing in the foreground. 

Robert De Niro, dressed in a white tank top and a headband, is positioned to the left of the frame. His facial expression appears tense as he looks directly at the camera. 

In the center of the frame stands Woody Harrelson, wearing a black tank top and a bandana on his head. He too looks directly at the camera with a serious expression.

To the right of Harrelson is Christopher Walken. He is shirtless and also wears a bandana on his head. His gaze is directed off to the side, adding an element of intrigue to his character.

The boat in the background has a tarp covering it, suggesting some sort of preparation or anticipation for what's to come. The overall composition of the image creates a sense of tension and suspense, characteristic of the film's noir genre.

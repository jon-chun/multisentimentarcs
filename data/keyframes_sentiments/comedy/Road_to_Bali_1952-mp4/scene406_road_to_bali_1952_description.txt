Behind him, a man in a blue shirt and cap is holding onto his back as they both look out over the water. The image evokes a sense of adventure and camaraderie between the two characters. The film-maker has used elements such as the natural setting, the positioning of the characters, and their attire to create this scene.

The rocky cliff adds a rugged texture to the scene, while the flowing river adds a sense of movement. The overall composition of the image is balanced, with the characters positioned centrally and the background elements framing them effectively.

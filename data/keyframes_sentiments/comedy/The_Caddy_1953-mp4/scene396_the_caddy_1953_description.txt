This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". The image is taken from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. In the center of the frame, Dorothy Gale, played by Judy Garland, stands at a table with her hand on it. She is surrounded by a group of people, including Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion, who are standing around her. The setting appears to be an outdoor park or garden, with trees visible in the background. The photograph has been edited to give it a grainy texture, adding to its vintage feel.

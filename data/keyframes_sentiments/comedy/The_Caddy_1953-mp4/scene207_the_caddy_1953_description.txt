The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in a room. The man on the left, dressed in a houndstooth suit with a white shirt and a tie, stands slightly behind the man on the right. The man on the right, wearing a tuxedo with a red scarf and a white flower pinned to his lapel, holds a glass of champagne in his hand. They are positioned against a backdrop of a window and a plant. The photograph is taken from a low angle, emphasizing the stature of the men. The monochrome color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene.

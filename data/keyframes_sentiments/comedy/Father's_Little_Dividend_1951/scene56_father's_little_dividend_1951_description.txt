The image captures a moment from the movie "Forrest Gump". In the center of the frame, we see the character Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks. He is seated at a desk in a room with a window and curtains in the background. Dressed in a white shirt and black vest, he holds a glass of beer in his right hand. His expression is one of sadness as he looks down at the desk. The overall color palette of the image is muted, adding to the somber mood of the scene.

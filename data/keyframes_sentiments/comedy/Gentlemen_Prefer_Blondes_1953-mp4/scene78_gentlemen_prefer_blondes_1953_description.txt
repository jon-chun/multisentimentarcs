Each dancer is wearing brown shorts and has his arms extended upwards, creating an impression of levitation. The dancer in the middle stands out with his black tank top, adding contrast to the otherwise uniform color scheme.

The background features a brick wall adorned with a wooden shelf holding various objects. A woman dressed in a black dress is standing behind the platform, her attention focused on the dancers. Her position and attire suggest she might be an audience member or perhaps a director overseeing the performance.

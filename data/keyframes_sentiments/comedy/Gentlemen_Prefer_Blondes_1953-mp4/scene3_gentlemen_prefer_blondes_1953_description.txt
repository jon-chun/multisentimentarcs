The image is a vibrant movie poster for the film "Act of Vengeance". The background of the poster is a gradient transitioning from purple at the top to pink at the bottom. 

At the center, there's a list of names in white text, presumably representing the cast and crew involved in the film. These names are arranged in two columns, with the left column being slightly taller than the right one. The text "Act of Vengeance" is prominently displayed at the top of the poster.

The overall layout of the poster suggests a sense of unity and collaboration among the individuals listed, hinting at the teamwork and coordination required for such a film project. The use of color and typography creates a visually appealing contrast that draws attention to the central list of names.

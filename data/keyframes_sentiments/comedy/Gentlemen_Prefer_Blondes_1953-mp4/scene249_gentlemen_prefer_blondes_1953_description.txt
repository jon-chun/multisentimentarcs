In the image, there are two women standing in a room with a wooden floor and walls. The woman on the left is dressed in a black suit and has blonde hair styled in loose curls. She is holding a blue garment bag in her hands. On the right, another woman is wearing a black dress adorned with red flowers. She is holding a gold lamp in one hand and a white card in the other. Both women are looking at each other, their expressions suggesting an intense conversation or interaction. The room they are in has a wooden floor and walls, adding to the overall warm tone of the image. The lighting in the room appears to be natural, coming from unseen sources outside the frame. The positioning of the women suggests that they are engaged in a discussion or negotiation, possibly related to the garment bag held by the woman on the left. The gold lamp and white card held by the woman on the right could indicate different roles or perspectives within their conversation.

The image captures a scene from the movie "Mank" featuring actress Amy Adams portraying the character of Mank Pfeiffer. She is seated at a desk in a room with dark wood paneling and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Dressed in a black dress adorned with white gloves, she holds a book in her hands. Beside her on the desk, there's a lamp casting light onto the scene. A man, presumably another character from the film, is seen kneeling before her. The image evokes a sense of intrigue and anticipation for the unfolding narrative.

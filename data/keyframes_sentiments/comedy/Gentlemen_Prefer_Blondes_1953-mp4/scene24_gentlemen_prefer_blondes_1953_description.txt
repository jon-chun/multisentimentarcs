In the foreground, a man dressed in a sharp black suit and hat stands out as he carries a stack of luggage. His posture suggests he's in motion, perhaps rushing to his next destination.

In contrast, a woman draped in a vibrant leopard print coat adds a touch of glamour and mystery to the scene. She's holding a large feathered fan, which she uses with grace and elegance. Her presence brings an air of sophistication and intrigue to the otherwise mundane hotel lobby.

Overall, the image beautifully encapsulates the essence of the movie - a blend of elegance, sophistication, and intrigue set against the backdrop of a busy hotel lobby.

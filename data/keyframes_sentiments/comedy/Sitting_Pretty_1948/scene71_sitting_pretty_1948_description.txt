The image is a black and white movie still featuring two men in suits. The man on the left, who is balding, is looking directly at the camera with a slight smile on his face. He has his hands tucked into his pockets, suggesting a relaxed demeanor. On the right, another man is holding a small object in his hand. His gaze is directed downwards and to the side, indicating that he might be deep in thought or observing something off-camera. The background consists of a wooden panelled wall with a window, adding an element of depth to the scene. The monochrome color scheme enhances the timeless quality of the image.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in an office setting. The central figure is a woman, seated at a desk equipped with a typewriter and a telephone. She is dressed in a short-sleeved blouse and a skirt, suggesting a professional attire for the era.

The desk, positioned against a wall, bears a sign that reads "Horatio J. Hammond Attorney at Law", indicating the profession of the woman. The office door, visible on the right side of the image, features a window with blinds partially drawn, allowing some light to filter into the room.

The lighting in the room appears soft, creating a calm and serene atmosphere. Despite being a black and white image, it vividly portrays the scene with its detailed depiction of objects and their relative positions.

In this black and white photograph, we see a scene from the movie "Double Indemnity" featuring actors Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck. They are seated at a table in a room adorned with curtains and a chandelier. 

Fred MacMurray, positioned on the left side of the frame, is dressed in a gray suit complemented by a white shirt and tie. His facial expression is one of surprise as he looks towards the right.

On the right side of the frame, Barbara Stanwyck is seen wearing a blue dress with a white collar. She too shares the same surprised look as she gazes towards the left.

The table between them holds a few items: a glass of water, a salt shaker, and a teapot. The room they're in has curtains that add to its charm, and a chandelier hangs from the ceiling, casting light around the room.

This image captures a moment of surprise and intrigue, as both characters seem caught off guard by something outside the frame.

The image captures a moment from the movie "Casablanca" featuring actors Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart. The scene unfolds in a garden setting, with a house and trees forming the backdrop. Ingrid Bergman, dressed in a white dress and apron, stands on the left side of the frame. She holds a basket filled with fruit, her gaze directed towards Humphrey Bogart who is seated on a bench on the right side of the image. Bogart, clad in a gray suit and hat, returns her gaze with equal intensity. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene, enhancing the emotional depth of the characters' expressions and interactions.

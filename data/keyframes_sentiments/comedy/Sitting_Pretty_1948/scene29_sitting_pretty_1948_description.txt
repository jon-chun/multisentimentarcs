This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two women. The woman on the left, dressed in a plaid dress with a bow at the back, is facing towards the right side of the frame. On the other hand, the woman on the right, adorned in a floral dress with a hat and flowers in her hair, is looking towards the left side of the image. Their gazes are directed at each other, suggesting an interaction or conversation between them. The background features a building with columns, providing context to their location. The monochrome palette adds a timeless quality to the scene.

The image is a black and white movie still from the film "The End". The background of the image is white, providing a stark contrast to the text elements. The title of the film, "The End", is written in large, bold letters at the top of the image. Below this, there's another line of text that reads "Released through Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation". This text is smaller and less prominent than the title.

The image does not contain any other discernible objects or elements. The simplicity of the image draws attention to the text, emphasizing the film's title and release information. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, fitting for a movie still from "The End".

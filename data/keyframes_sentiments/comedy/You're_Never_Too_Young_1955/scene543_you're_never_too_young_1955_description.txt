The image captures a moment of tranquility on the water. A person, clad in a blue jacket and a white helmet, is seated on a red and white boat. The boat's name, "SPECIAL", is prominently displayed on its side. The individual appears to be engaged in an activity involving a small motorboat that rests on the water nearby. The scene is set against a backdrop of a serene body of water under a clear blue sky. The overall composition suggests a leisurely day out on the water, with the person and the boat as the main subjects.

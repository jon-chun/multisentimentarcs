In the image, there are two men in a room with white walls and a window. The man on the left is sitting on a wooden chair with a high backrest. He is wearing a white shirt and has his arms crossed over his chest. The man on the right is standing behind him, dressed in a blue shirt and tie. They are both looking at something or someone off-camera. The room they are in appears to be quite simple and uncluttered. There are no other objects or people visible in the image.

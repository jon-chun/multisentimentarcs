The image captures a lively scene at an outdoor market. The market is bustling with people, some of whom are seated on wooden benches while others stand around, engaged in various activities. The market is adorned with vibrant red and white decorations that add to the festive atmosphere.

In the background, there's a building with a sign that reads "Kedai 26-28 CE", possibly indicating the name or location of the market. The photo appears to have been taken during the day, as suggested by the natural lighting illuminating the scene.

The image does not contain any discernible text apart from the sign on the building. The relative positions of the objects and people suggest a well-organized space, with clear paths for movement and interaction.

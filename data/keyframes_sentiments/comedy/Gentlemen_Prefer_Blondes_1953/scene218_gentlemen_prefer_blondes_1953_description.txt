The image captures a scene from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". The central focus is on Dorothy, who is in mid-air, seemingly defying gravity. She's dressed in a black dress and holds a silver umbrella in her hand. Her face is contorted with an expression of fear or surprise.

Below her, a young boy in a blue suit is seated on a wooden bench. He appears to be watching the spectacle unfold above him. The setting is a room painted in shades of gray, providing a stark contrast to the vibrant colors of Dorothy's dress and umbrella.

The image is framed by a gold border, adding an element of grandeur to the scene. In the background, there's a large window with a circular window, allowing natural light to filter into the room. The overall composition of the image suggests a moment of suspense or wonder in the narrative of the movie.

The setting appears to be a room with white walls and a wooden floor, giving it a simple yet warm ambiance. A bookshelf filled with various books forms the backdrop of the scene, hinting at Forrest's intellectual pursuits or interests.

In terms of color, the image is dominated by the blue of Forrest's suit, the brown of the wooden bench and bookshelf, and the white of the room walls. The lighting seems natural and soft, casting a gentle glow on the scene.

In the background, there are other people present, but they are blurred and not the main focus of the image. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet contemplation, as if Forrest Gump has momentarily paused his journey to reflect on his life.

The color palette of the image is muted, with the blue of Forrest's suit standing out against the darker tones of the room. The lighting is soft and diffused, adding to the serene and introspective mood of the scene.

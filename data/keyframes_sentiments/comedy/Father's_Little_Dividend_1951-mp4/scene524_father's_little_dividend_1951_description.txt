The image captures a scene from the movie "Forrest Gump". In the center of the frame, Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks) is standing on the left side. He's dressed in a black suit and a white shirt, his arms outstretched as if he's embracing someone or something. On the right side of the image, we see Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright Penn). She's wearing a pink dress and appears to be crying. The setting is a room with curtains and a window in the background. The overall mood of the image is one of sadness and longing.

The image is a black and white movie still capturing a moment between two characters in a room. The man, positioned on the right side of the frame, is dressed in a tweed jacket adorned with a flower lapel pin. He gazes off to the left, his expression serious. On the left side of the frame, a woman is seen wearing a white dress and looking towards the man. The room they are in has a window on the right wall, adding depth to the scene. The monochrome palette enhances the dramatic effect of the image.

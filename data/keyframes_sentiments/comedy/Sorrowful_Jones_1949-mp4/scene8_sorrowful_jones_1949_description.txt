This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in front of a building. The man on the right, donned in a suit and hat, stands slightly behind the woman on the left, who is wearing a striped shirt and a headscarf. They are positioned in front of a window that bears the sign "Kroatisch". The background reveals a street scene with cars and buildings, adding depth to the image. The monochrome palette enhances the timeless quality of this moment.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Casablanca". The image features three characters: Rick Blaine, Ilsa Rydberg, and Sam. They are standing in a room adorned with paintings on the wall and a fireplace.

Rick Blaine, portrayed by Humphrey Bogart, is positioned on the left side of the frame. He is dressed in a white shirt, black vest, and a fedora hat. His facial expression is neutral as he gazes at Ilsa.

Ilsa Rydberg, played by Ingrid Bergman, stands in the middle of the photo. She is wearing a green dress and her face carries a look of concern as she looks at Rick.

On the right side of the frame is Sam, played by Dooley Wilson. He is dressed in a black suit and tie. His expression mirrors Ilsa's concern as he too looks at Rick.

The room they are in has a fireplace and paintings on the wall, adding to the ambiance of the scene. The monochrome color scheme enhances the dramatic effect of this iconic moment from cinema history.

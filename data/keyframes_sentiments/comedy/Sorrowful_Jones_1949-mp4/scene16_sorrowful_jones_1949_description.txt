This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The scene unfolds in front of a building, which prominently displays the sign "TERMINUS". 

In the foreground, two individuals are seen walking away from the camera. They are dressed in formal attire, suggesting they might be returning from an event or heading to one. Their body language and direction indicate movement, adding dynamism to the scene.

To the right of the frame, another person is captured mid-stride, moving towards the camera. This individual's position and direction create a sense of depth and perspective in the photograph.

The background features a car parked on the street, further emphasizing the urban setting. The presence of trees adds a touch of nature to the otherwise concrete environment.

Despite being a still image, it tells a story of city life, capturing the movement and energy of its inhabitants.

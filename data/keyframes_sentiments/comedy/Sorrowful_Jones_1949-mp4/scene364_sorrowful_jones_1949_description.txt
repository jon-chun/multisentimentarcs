This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals seated on a bench. The person on the left, dressed in a gray suit with a striped tie, holds a cigarette in their hand. On the right, the other individual is attired in a dark-colored dress, also holding a cigarette. Both are looking off to the side, their expressions serious and thoughtful. The background features a wall adorned with windows, adding depth to the scene. The monochrome palette enhances the timeless quality of this moment.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between a man and a horse. The man, dressed in a suit, stands to the left of the frame, his hand gently resting on the horse's neck. The horse, draped in a blanket with a diamond pattern, stands calmly to the right. The background features a window and a door, providing context to their location within a building. The monochrome palette adds a timeless quality to the scene, emphasizing the subjects' expressions and actions over color details.

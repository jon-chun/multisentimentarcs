This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Casablanca". The image features three main characters: Ilsa Lund, Rick Blaine, and Sam. 

Ilsa Lund, played by Ingrid Bergman, is positioned on the left side of the frame. She is dressed in a white blouse adorned with a black bow tie, paired with a plaid skirt. Her facial expression is one of concern as she looks at Rick.

Rick Blaine, portrayed by Humphrey Bogart, stands in the center of the image. He is attired in a white shirt and suspenders, exuding an air of confidence as he looks directly at Ilsa.

On the right side of the frame is Sam, played by Dooley Wilson. He is seen wearing a black vest and tie, adding to the overall monochrome aesthetic of the photograph.

The setting is a room with a door visible in the background, providing context to their location within the movie. The composition of the image places Ilsa and Rick at the center, drawing attention to their interaction, while Sam's position on the right balances the scene.

The use of black and white for this still adds a timeless quality to the image, emphasizing the emotions and expressions of the characters over color details. The absence of any text or other elements keeps the focus solely on the characters and their interactions.

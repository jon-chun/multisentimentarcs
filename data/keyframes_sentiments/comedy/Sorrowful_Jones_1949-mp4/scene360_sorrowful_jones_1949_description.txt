Don Vito, positioned on the left side of the frame, is dressed in a suit and tie, exuding an air of authority and wisdom. His gaze is directed towards Carmela, who is seated on a chair on the right side of the image. She is attired in a dress, her hand delicately placed over her mouth as if in surprise or contemplation.

The room they occupy is characterized by a wooden floor and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, adding to the grandeur of the setting. The painting of the peacock on the wall behind them adds an element of intrigue to the scene.

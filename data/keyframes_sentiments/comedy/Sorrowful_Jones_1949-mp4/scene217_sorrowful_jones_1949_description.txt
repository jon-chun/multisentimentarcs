The image is a black and white movie still capturing a moment of interaction between three men in a room. The man on the left, donned in a suit and hat, stands slightly apart from the other two. In the middle, another man in a suit and tie holds a briefcase, his gaze directed towards the third man. This third man, wearing a striped shirt and suspenders, is positioned to the right of the middle man. The room they are in has a door visible on the left side of the frame. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to this scene.

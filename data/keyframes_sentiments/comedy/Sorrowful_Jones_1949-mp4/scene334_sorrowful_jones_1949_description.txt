She is dressed in a dark dress with a checkered pattern, mirroring Brando's suit but with a different design. Like Pacino, her gaze is also directed towards Brondo, suggesting she is part of the conversation.

The characters are positioned in such a way that they form an almost straight line across the frame, creating a sense of balance and symmetry in the composition. The background features a fireplace and a painting on the wall, adding depth to the scene and providing context for the setting.

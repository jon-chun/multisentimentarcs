This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "My Best Guess". The central figure in the image is actor Michael Caine, who is holding a newspaper with the headline "Wife of 17 years". He is wearing a suit and tie, and his facial expression conveys a sense of shock or disbelief. In the background, there are two other individuals - one woman and one man. The woman appears to be in mid-sentence, suggesting she might be speaking, while the man's posture is more neutral. The setting appears to be an indoor room with a window visible on the right side of the image. The overall composition of the image places Michael Caine as the focal point, drawing attention to his reaction and expression.

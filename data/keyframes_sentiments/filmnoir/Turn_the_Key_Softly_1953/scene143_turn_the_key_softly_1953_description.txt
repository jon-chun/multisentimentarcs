This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The main subject of the image is a double-decker bus, which is parked on the right side of the frame. The bus is facing towards the left side of the photo, suggesting it's ready to move in that direction.

In front of the bus, there are two individuals - one standing and the other walking. Their exact actions or expressions are not clear due to their blurred appearance, possibly indicating movement or a focus on the bus as the primary subject.

The background of the image reveals more about the setting. There's a building visible behind the bus, and a traffic light can be seen further down the street. The presence of these elements suggests an urban environment with typical city infrastructure.

Despite being in black and white, the photograph manages to convey a sense of time and place, capturing a common scene one might encounter in a bustling city.

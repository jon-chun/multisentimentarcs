This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The image features two buses, one white and the other black, parked side by side in front of a building with a sign that reads "Haymarket". The bus on the left is white and has a rounded front, while the bus on the right is black and has a flat front. In the background, there's a tram line running parallel to the street. The sky above is hazy, adding a sense of depth to the image. Despite being in black and white, the photograph beautifully captures the everyday life of the city.

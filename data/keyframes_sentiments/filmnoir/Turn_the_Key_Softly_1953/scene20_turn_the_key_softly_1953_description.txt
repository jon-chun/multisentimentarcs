Marilyn Monroe is dressed in a light-colored blouse adorned with a dark-colored collar and cuffs, which contrasts with her skin tone. A pearl necklace graces her neck, adding a touch of elegance to her outfit. Her hair is styled in loose waves, framing her face beautifully.

Her facial expression is one of concern or worry, as if she's deeply engrossed in thought or anticipating an event. This expression, combined with her body language and the setting, creates a sense of tension and suspense.

The camera angle is low, looking up at Monroe, which emphasizes her stature and presence. The lighting is soft, focusing on Monroe's face and upper body while leaving the background in shadow. This technique draws attention to Monroe as the main subject of the image.

The color palette is dominated by shades of gray and black, with the exception of Monroe's blouse which stands out due to its light color. The contrast between the dark background and Monroe's light-colored blouse creates a striking visual effect.

Overall, this image captures a moment of tension and suspense in a dimly lit urban setting, with Monroe's expression and body language adding depth to the scene.

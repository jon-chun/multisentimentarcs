The image is a black and white movie still featuring three women standing in front of a stone wall. The woman on the left, clad in a coat and hat, holds a bag in her hand. The woman in the middle, also dressed in a coat and hat, has a purse slung over her shoulder. The woman on the right is wearing a dress with a pearl necklace and a fur stole draped over her shoulders. All three women are looking off to the side, their expressions serious. The stone wall behind them provides a textured backdrop, while the black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene.

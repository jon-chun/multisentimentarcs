This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of three women standing in front of a stone wall. The woman on the left, clad in a gray coat, gazes directly at the camera with a slight smile playing on her lips. In the middle, another woman in a matching gray coat holds a large piece of paper, her attention seemingly drawn to something off-frame. To the right, the third woman is dressed in a white coat and also looks towards the left, her expression mirroring that of the second woman. The stone wall behind them provides a textured backdrop, while the low angle from which the photo is taken adds a sense of grandeur to the scene. Despite being in black and white, the image conveys a rich tapestry of emotions and tells a story open to interpretation.

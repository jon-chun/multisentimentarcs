This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The main subject of the image is a woman, who is walking away from the camera. She is dressed in a long coat and hat, suggesting it might be a cold day or she's going for a classic look. In her hand, she carries a purse, indicating she might be out running errands or returning from work.

The setting of the image is an urban environment with buildings visible in the background. The woman appears to be walking on the sidewalk, further emphasizing that this is a city street scene.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman. This perspective adds a sense of depth and dimension to the image, making the woman appear larger and more prominent.

In terms of lighting, the image has a somewhat grainy texture, which could be due to the black and white filter or perhaps an intentional artistic choice by the photographer. The overall composition of the photograph is balanced with the woman positioned in the center of the frame.

Please note that as this is a black and white image, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the contrast between light and dark areas provides depth and detail to the scene.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a scene in an urban setting. The main focus of the image is a set of stairs, which are located on the left side of the frame. The stairs lead up to a building that has a window visible above them. 

On the right side of the photo, there's a railing with lights attached to it, adding a touch of brightness to the otherwise monochrome scene. The background features a brick wall and a tree, providing a contrast between the man-made structures and nature.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the stairs and the building above them. This perspective gives a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. 

In terms of facial expression, there are no people visible in the image, so it's not possible to analyze their expressions. However, the overall composition of the photograph suggests a quiet, perhaps contemplative atmosphere. The body language and gestures of any potential subjects would depend on factors such as lighting, shadows, and other visual cues that aren't present in this still image.

As for props and costumes, there are no discernible objects or clothing items in the image. The focus is purely on the architectural elements - the stairs, the railing with lights, and the building above them.

The depth of field is not explicitly shown in the image as it's a still photo without any moving objects to create motion blur. However, given that it's a black and white photograph, one can assume that the focus would be on the contrast between light and dark areas rather than color.

In terms of visual effects and post-processing, there are no discernible alterations or manipulations in the image. It appears to be a straightforward representation of an urban scene captured with a camera.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in an office setting. The image features two individuals: one seated at a desk, the other standing behind them.

The person seated at the desk is dressed in a dark-colored suit, holding a pen in their hand. Their posture suggests they are engaged in some form of work or discussion.

Standing behind the seated individual is another person, distinguishable by their light-colored scarf and hat. They appear to be observing the scene from behind the seated person.

The background reveals an office environment with a window and a door, providing context for the setting. The monochrome color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image.

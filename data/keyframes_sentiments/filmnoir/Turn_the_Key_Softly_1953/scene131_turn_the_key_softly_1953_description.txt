This is a black and white movie still featuring two women in a room. The woman on the left is dressed in a gray coat and hat, holding a large bag in her hand. She stands slightly behind the other woman, who is wearing a light-colored dress and holds a small purse. They are positioned in front of a door and a window, with the door to their left and the window to their right. The room they are in has a wooden floor and a rug underfoot. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a sense of quiet conversation or contemplation between the two women.

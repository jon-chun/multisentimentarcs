The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in time on a city street. The main focus of the image is a clock, which is mounted on the side of a building. The clock has a square shape with a round face, featuring Roman numerals for numbers and hands. 

The building itself is constructed from brick and has multiple windows. It's located on a street lined with other buildings, suggesting an urban setting. 

In terms of camera angle, the photo appears to be taken from a low angle, looking up at the clock. This perspective emphasizes the height of the building and the prominence of the clock in the scene.

The lighting in the image is diffused, indicating that it might have been taken during the day under overcast skies or with a soft light source.

The composition of the photo places the clock as the central element, drawing the viewer's attention to it. The other buildings in the background provide context and depth to the scene.

Despite being a black and white image, the varying shades of gray create contrast and add texture to the photograph. There are no discernible colors due to the monochromatic nature of the photo.

There are no facial expressions or body language visible in the image as it focuses on an inanimate object - the clock. 

No props or costumes are present in the image, and there is no text visible. The depth of field is shallow, with the clock in sharp focus and the background slightly blurred, further emphasizing its importance.

The character positioning and interaction cannot be determined from this still image as it captures a single moment in time. There are no visual effects or post-processing elements present in the photo. 

Overall, the image is a study in composition and contrast, with the clock serving as a focal point amidst an urban backdrop.

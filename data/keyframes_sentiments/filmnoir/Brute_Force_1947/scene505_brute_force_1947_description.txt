This is a black and white photograph capturing a dramatic scene in front of a brick building. The building features a large clock, which is currently ablaze with fire. The flames are visible on the right side of the photo.

In the foreground, there are two individuals lying on the ground. One of them appears to be dead, while the other is alive and crawling towards the burning building. Their exact positions relative to each other or the building cannot be determined from this description.

On the left side of the photo, another individual is standing upright. They seem to be observing the scene unfolding before them.

The photograph does not contain any discernible text. The overall mood of the image is one of chaos and destruction, as suggested by the burning clock and the distressed individuals in the foreground.

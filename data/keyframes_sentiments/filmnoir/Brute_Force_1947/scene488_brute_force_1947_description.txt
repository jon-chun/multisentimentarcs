The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of time. The central focus of the image is a round clock with a white face and black numbers, which reads 11:30. The clock is positioned on the right side of the frame, set against a backdrop of a brick wall. 

Adding to the dramatic effect of the scene, flames are seen dancing around the clock, their flickering light illuminating the surroundings. The flames appear to be in motion, creating a sense of urgency or time running out.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the size and importance of the clock. This perspective also gives us a unique view of the flames, making them appear larger and more intense.

Despite being a black and white image, the contrast between the light and dark areas creates depth and texture in the scene. The brick wall provides a rough texture that contrasts with the smooth surface of the clock.

Overall, this image evokes emotions of urgency and time running out, emphasized by the dancing flames and the low angle shot of the clock.

In the black and white photograph, a man in a military uniform stands assertively with his arms crossed. His gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting a sense of focus or contemplation. The uniform he wears signifies authority and discipline, while the dark background behind him adds to the overall somber tone of the image.

The camera angle is particularly striking, taken from a low angle looking up at the man. This perspective enhances his stature and dominance in the frame. The lighting in the photograph is dramatic, with the light source positioned on the right side of the image, casting shadows that add depth and contrast to the scene.

The framing and composition of the photograph are also noteworthy. The man's position in the center of the frame draws the viewer's attention directly to him, while the dark background provides a stark contrast that further emphasizes his figure. The absence of color in the photograph allows for a focus on the textures and patterns within the image, from the folds of the uniform to the grain of the film.

The setting and background are minimalistic, with no other objects or individuals present. This simplicity serves to highlight the man and his actions, allowing the viewer to fully appreciate the emotion conveyed through his facial expression, body language, and gestures.

In terms of color, the photograph is in black and white, which further enhances the dramatic effect of the lighting and shadows. The lack of color also allows for a focus on the contrast between light and dark areas within the image.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements to create a powerful and evocative scene, with each component contributing to the overall mood and atmosphere of the photograph.

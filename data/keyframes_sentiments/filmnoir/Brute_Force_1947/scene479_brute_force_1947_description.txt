This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the film "Westgate Penitentiary". The image features two men, both dressed in dark clothing. One man is standing on a platform, holding a gun with a determined expression. The other man is walking towards him, also armed with a gun. They are positioned against a backdrop of a brick wall and a window. The photograph has been edited to have a grainy texture, adding to the overall dramatic effect of the scene.

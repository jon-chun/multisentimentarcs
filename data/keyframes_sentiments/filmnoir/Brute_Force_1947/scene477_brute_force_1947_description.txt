On the right, the other man appears to be in a state of fear or resignation, as indicated by his facial expression and body language. He is looking at the man with the gun, perhaps anticipating what will happen next.

The train car setting adds an element of tension to the scene, suggesting that this confrontation might be happening during a journey or while traveling.

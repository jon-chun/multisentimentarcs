This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men. The man on the left, dressed in a light-colored jacket, sports a dark-colored cap. He stands with his gaze directed towards the right, where another man is positioned. This second man, attired in a dark-colored suit and hat, returns the gaze of the first man. They are both standing against a backdrop of a building adorned with columns and windows. The image exudes an air of formality and seriousness, emphasized by the men's attire and the architectural setting.

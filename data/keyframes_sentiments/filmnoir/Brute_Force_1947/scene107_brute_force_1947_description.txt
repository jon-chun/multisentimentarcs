The man on the left is actively operating the machine, his hands firmly gripping the controls. His posture suggests concentration and familiarity with the equipment.

On the right, the other man is observing the process closely. He stands slightly behind and to the side of the first man, his attention focused on the machine's operation.

The workshop itself is filled with various tools and machinery, indicative of a well-equipped workspace. The background reveals a brick wall, adding an industrial touch to the scene.

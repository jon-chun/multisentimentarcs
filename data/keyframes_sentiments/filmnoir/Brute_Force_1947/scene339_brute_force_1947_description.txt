The image is a black and white movie still from the film "On the Waterfront". The scene takes place in a room with a staircase. A man, dressed in a suit and tie, stands on the staircase. His facial expression is serious and he is looking off to the side. Behind him, a woman sits on a chair. She is wearing a hat and her gaze is directed towards the man. The composition of the image places the man as the central figure with the woman positioned in the background. The use of black and white adds a timeless quality to the scene.

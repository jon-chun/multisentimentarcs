The image is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The scene takes place in a car with two characters, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Ilsa is seated on the passenger side of the car, looking out of the window with a concerned expression. On the driver's side, Rick gazes at Ilsa with a pensive look. The car is parked in front of a building, and power lines can be seen in the background. The monochrome color scheme adds to the dramatic atmosphere of the scene.

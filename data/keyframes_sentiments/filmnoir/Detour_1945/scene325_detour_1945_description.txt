The props and costumes in the image are minimalistic, focusing on the two main subjects and their interaction. There are no discernible texts or other objects that can be counted or located precisely within the image.

Overall, this photograph captures a candid moment between two individuals, with elements such as facial expressions, body language, composition, and lighting contributing to the overall narrative of the scene.

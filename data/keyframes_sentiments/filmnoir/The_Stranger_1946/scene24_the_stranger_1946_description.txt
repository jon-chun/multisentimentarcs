This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between two men. The man on the left, donned in a suit and hat, stands in front of a car window with his back to the camera. His posture suggests he might be engaged in conversation or observing something outside the frame. 

On the right side of the image, another man is seated inside the car. He is dressed similarly to the first man, wearing a suit and hat. His gaze is directed towards the standing man, indicating an exchange between them.

The background reveals a building with a clock tower, adding depth to the scene. The time on the clock isn't visible in the image. The overall composition of the photograph suggests it could be from an older era, given the style of clothing and the black and white color scheme.

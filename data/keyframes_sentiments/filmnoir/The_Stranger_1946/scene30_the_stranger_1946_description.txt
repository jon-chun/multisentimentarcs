This is a black and white photograph capturing the entrance to Harper School for Boys, established in 1877. The image features a stone building with a curved roof, serving as the entrance. A sign prominently displayed on the building reads "Harper School for Boys Established 1877", indicating the institution's history and purpose.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the building, which adds a sense of grandeur and importance to the structure. The sky forms the backdrop of the image, providing context and scale to the scene.

In terms of lighting, the sun casts shadows on the left side of the building, adding depth and contrast to the image. The absence of color in the photograph focuses attention on the shapes, textures, and patterns within the scene.

The composition of the image places the entrance as the central focus, with the surrounding elements serving to highlight its significance. The low angle shot, combined with the sun's shadows, creates a dramatic effect that underscores the importance of this landmark.

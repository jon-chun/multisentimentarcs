The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actress Marilyn Monroe. She is standing in front of a curtain, her head tilted to the side as she gazes off to the side with a slight smile playing on her lips. Her attire consists of a striped dress adorned with black buttons. The monochrome palette of the photograph enhances the timeless elegance of Monroe's persona.

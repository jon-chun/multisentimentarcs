This is a black and white photograph capturing a scene in a hallway. The hallway is characterized by its marble floor and walls, which are adorned with columns on either side. 

On the left side of the hallway, there's a wooden chair with a metal frame. The chair is unoccupied, adding to the sense of solitude in the image.

On the right side of the hallway, there's a large urn made of metal. The urn has a handle and a spout on top, suggesting it might be used for pouring liquids.

The background of the image features a door with a window at the top, providing a glimpse into another room beyond the hallway. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a quiet and serene atmosphere.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of quiet intensity. The central figure is a woman, her face the focal point of the composition. She is adorned with a black headband, from which dangles a single feather, adding an element of intrigue to her appearance.

Her gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting a sense of contemplation or distraction. Her expression is serious, perhaps indicative of deep thought or concern. The woman's attire consists of a dark-colored dress, embellished with black sequins that add texture and depth to the image.

The background is blurred, drawing attention back to the woman and creating a sense of depth in the photograph. Despite the lack of color, the image is rich in detail and evokes a strong emotional response through its composition and subject matter.

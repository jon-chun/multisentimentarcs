This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Pulp Fiction". The image features two main characters, John Travolta as the character of Vincent Vega and Samuel L. Jackson as the character of Jules Winnfield.

Vincent Vega, played by John Travolta, is positioned on the left side of the frame. He is dressed in a black suit adorned with white polka dots. In his hand, he holds a black bag, possibly containing important documents or items related to their mission.

On the right side of the frame, we see Jules Winnfield, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. He is wearing a black suit similar to Vincent's but distinguished by a red stripe on the lapel. Jules is seated at a desk, engrossed in reading a newspaper. His posture suggests he is deeply absorbed in the contents of the paper.

The background of the image reveals a room with a bookshelf and a window, suggesting an indoor setting possibly a hotel or motel room. The overall composition of the image creates a sense of tension and anticipation, characteristic of the film's narrative.

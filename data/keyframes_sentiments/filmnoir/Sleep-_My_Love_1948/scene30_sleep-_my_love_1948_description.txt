In this black and white image, we see the renowned actor Alain Delon, embodying his character from the film "The Pajama Game". He is standing in a bedroom, engaged in a conversation over the phone. Dressed in a gray robe, he holds the receiver to his ear with his left hand while his right hand rests on his hip. The room around him is dimly lit, adding an air of mystery to the scene. A window can be seen in the background, its curtains drawn partially back. The overall composition of the image suggests a quiet moment of solitude and introspection.

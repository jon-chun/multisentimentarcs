The setting is an indoor room, characterized by a wooden floor that adds to the warm ambiance of the club. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling, casting light onto the scene below. In the background, other people can be seen sitting at tables, possibly enjoying the performance or waiting for their turn to perform.

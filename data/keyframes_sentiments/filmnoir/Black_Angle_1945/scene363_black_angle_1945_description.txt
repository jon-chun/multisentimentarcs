The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in a room. The woman, positioned on the left side of the frame, is elegantly dressed in a long gown adorned with beaded embroidery. She holds a small clutch purse in her hand, adding to her poised demeanor. 

On the right side of the image, the man is attired in a classic tuxedo, complete with a bow tie and a white pocket square peeking from his jacket. Both individuals are looking off to the left side of the frame, their attention seemingly captured by something outside the photograph's scope.

The room they're in has a window on the left wall, suggesting it might be evening or night outside. A painting hangs on the right wall, contributing to the room's decor. The overall composition and lighting suggest a formal event or gathering.

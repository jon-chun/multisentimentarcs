This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals. The woman, positioned on the left side of the frame, is dressed in a floral dress and her gaze is directed towards the man. On the right side of the frame, the man is attired in a suit and tie, looking off to the side with a slight smile gracing his face. The backdrop features a window draped with curtains, adding depth to the scene. The monochrome palette enhances the timeless quality of this image.

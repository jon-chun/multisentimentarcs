This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between two individuals. The person on the left, donned in a hat, is seen holding a cane with their right hand. Their gaze is directed towards the person on the right, who is wearing a suit and tie. This individual is also holding a cane with their left hand, but their attention seems to be elsewhere, as they are looking off to the side. The background of the image features a building adorned with columns, adding an architectural element to the scene. The overall composition suggests a formal or professional setting.

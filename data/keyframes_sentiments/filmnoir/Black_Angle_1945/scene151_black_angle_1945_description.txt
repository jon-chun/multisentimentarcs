This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in what appears to be a room with a desk. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and tie, stands behind the woman who is positioned slightly to his right. She is wearing a dress adorned with a floral pattern. Both of them are looking off to the side, their faces etched with expressions of concern or worry. The image evokes a sense of tension and unease, amplified by the stark contrast between the subjects' attire and the monochrome setting.

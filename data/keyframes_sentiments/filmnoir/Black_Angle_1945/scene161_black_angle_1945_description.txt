The woman, dressed in a checkered suit, stands on the right side of the frame, her gaze directed to the left where the man is seated. He is attired in a striped suit. The room they occupy is adorned with wallpaper and features a window that allows light to filter in, casting a soft glow on the scene. The woman's posture suggests she is engaged in conversation with the man, who appears to be listening attentively.

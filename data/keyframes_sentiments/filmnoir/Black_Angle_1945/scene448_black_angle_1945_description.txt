The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of quiet introspection. The main subject is a telephone, its cord trailing off the frame to the right, suggesting it's connected to an unseen source outside the frame. The phone rests on a table covered with a white tablecloth, adding a touch of elegance to the scene.

In front of the phone, there's a glass ashtray holding a single cigarette butt, hinting at a recent or ongoing activity. The background features a window adorned with curtains and a lamp, providing context to the setting as a domestic interior space.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the phone, which adds a sense of depth and perspective to the image. This angle also emphasizes the telephone's importance in this scene. Despite being a still image, it tells a story of solitude, perhaps even longing, evoked by these everyday objects arranged in a specific way.

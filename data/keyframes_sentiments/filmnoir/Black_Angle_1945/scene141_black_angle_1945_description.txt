The image is a black and white movie still featuring two characters in a room. The woman, positioned on the left side of the frame, is wearing a checkered dress and a wide-brimmed hat. She stands with her hands resting at her sides, her gaze directed towards the man on the right. The man, dressed in a suit and tie, holds a cigarette in his hand. He too looks at the woman. The room they are in has a door visible in the background. The overall composition of the image suggests a moment of interaction between the two characters.

The image captures a scene from the movie "A Street Dancer", featuring actor Prithviraj in his role as the character, Raj. The setting is a garden at night, illuminated by the soft glow of string lights and lanterns. Prithviraj, dressed in a white shirt, stands on the left side of the frame, his gaze directed towards the right where actress Kavya Madhavan, clad in a black dress, holds a bouquet of flowers. The overall mood of the image is one of quiet intimacy, as Raj and Kalyani share a moment under the starlit sky.

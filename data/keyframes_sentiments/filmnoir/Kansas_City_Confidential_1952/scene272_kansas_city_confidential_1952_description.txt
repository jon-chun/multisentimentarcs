The image is a black and white photograph capturing a serene moment at a poolside. The main focus of the image is a person, who appears to be in motion, walking along the edge of the pool. The pool itself is rectangular in shape and has a flat bottom, reflecting the calmness of the scene.

In the background, there's a hedge, providing a natural boundary for the area. Beyond the hedge, trees can be seen, adding depth to the image and creating a sense of tranquility. The person walking along the pool is positioned on the right side of the photo, moving towards the left side of the frame.

Despite being a black and white image, it's rich in detail and evokes a sense of calmness and tranquility. The absence of color focuses the viewer's attention on the shapes, textures, and composition of the scene. The photograph beautifully captures this moment in time, creating a visually appealing and emotionally engaging image.

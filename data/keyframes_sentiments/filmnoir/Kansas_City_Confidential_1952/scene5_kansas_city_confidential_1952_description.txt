The image presents a stark contrast between the black background and the white text. The text is arranged in three distinct lines, each line carrying a part of the sentence. The first line reads "In the police annals of Kansas City", followed by "are written lurid chapters concerning" on the second line. The third line concludes the sentence with "the exploits of criminals apprehended and brought to punishment". The text is centrally aligned, creating a sense of balance in the image. The simplicity of the color scheme and the layout draws attention to the message conveyed through the text.

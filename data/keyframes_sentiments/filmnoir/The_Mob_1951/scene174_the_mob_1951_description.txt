The image is a black and white movie still capturing a moment of tension between two men inside a car. The man on the left, donned in a leather jacket and a baseball cap, is seen with his gaze directed towards the right side of the frame. On the other hand, the man on the right, wearing a suit and tie, has his attention focused straight ahead. The interior of the car forms the backdrop of this scene, with the dashboard visible in the foreground. The absence of color and the stark contrast between light and dark areas contribute to the overall dramatic effect of the image.

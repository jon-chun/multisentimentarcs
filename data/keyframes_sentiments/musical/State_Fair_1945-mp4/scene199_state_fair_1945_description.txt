On either side of the track, there are two gray cars, each carrying passengers who appear to be enjoying the ride. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the mechanical structure of the roller coaster.

In the foreground, there's a white circular object with a black center, possibly part of the park's infrastructure or an interactive element for visitors.

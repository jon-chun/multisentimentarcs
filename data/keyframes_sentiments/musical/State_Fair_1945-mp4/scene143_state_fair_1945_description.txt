The image captures a scene from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". The main focus is on Glinda, played by actress Liza Minnelli. She is standing in front of a silver booth that reads "Chaplin's". Glinda is dressed in a blue and white dress adorned with red stripes, and she's wearing white shoes. Her hair is styled in loose curls.

The setting appears to be a circus tent, characterized by its green and white striped awning. In the background, there are other people present, but they are blurred and not the main focus of the image. The overall atmosphere suggests a lively and bustling environment typical of a circus setting.

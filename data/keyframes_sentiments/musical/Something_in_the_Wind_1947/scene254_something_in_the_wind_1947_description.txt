Rick Blaine, dressed in a dark suit and tie, stands on the left side of the frame. His facial expression is serious as he looks at Ilsa. On the right side of the frame, Ilsa Lund is seen wearing a black dress and hat. She appears to be looking away from Rick.

The room they are in has a staircase leading up to an unseen upper level. The lighting in the room is dim, adding to the dramatic atmosphere of the scene. The composition of the image places Rick and Ilsa at the center, drawing attention to their interaction.

In terms of color, as this is a black and white photo, there are no colors visible. However, the contrast between light and dark areas adds depth to the image.

Rick's body language suggests he is in a state of contemplation or seriousness, while Ilsa's gaze directed away from Rick could indicate she is lost in thought or avoiding direct conversation.

In terms of props and costumes, both characters are dressed in formal attire. Rick's suit and tie contrast with Ilsa's black dress and hat, highlighting their different roles within the scene.

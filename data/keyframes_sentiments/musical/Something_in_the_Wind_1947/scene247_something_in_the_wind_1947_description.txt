Her gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting deep thought or contemplation. She is dressed in a long coat and a hat, typical of the fashion of the time period this photo represents. The lighting in the image is dim, adding to the overall somber mood of the scene. The background consists of a hallway with a staircase, providing context for Ingrid Bergman's character. The monochrome color scheme enhances the dramatic effect of the image.

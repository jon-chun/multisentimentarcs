This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in what appears to be a living room setting. The person on the left, dressed in a long black dress with a high neckline, holds a glass of wine in their hand. On the right, the other individual is attired in a military uniform complete with a peaked cap, and they are holding a cigarette. The photograph is taken from a low angle, adding a sense of grandeur to the scene. The lighting is diffused, creating a soft glow that illuminates the subjects. In the background, a couch can be seen, along with other people who are blurred out, suggesting that this moment was captured in a social gathering or event.

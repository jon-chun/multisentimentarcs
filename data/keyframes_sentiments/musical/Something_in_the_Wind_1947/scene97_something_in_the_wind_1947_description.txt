Phyllis Dietrich, dressed in a black dress with her hair styled in loose curls, is seated at a desk. She holds a large ball in her hand, her face reflecting a look of surprise or shock. Her body language suggests she has just been confronted or startled.

Standing next to the desk is Sam Spade, clad in a gray suit and tie. His expression is serious as he looks at Phyllis Dietrich, indicating an intense conversation or confrontation between them.

The background features a large window with curtains drawn back, suggesting it might be night time. The room is dimly lit, adding to the overall atmosphere of suspense and tension.

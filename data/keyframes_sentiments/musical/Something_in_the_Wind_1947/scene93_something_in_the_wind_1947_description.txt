This is a black and white movie still from the film "Double Indemnity". The image captures a moment of suspense and tension between two characters, Phyllis Dietrich (played by Barbara Stanwyck) and George Smalley (played by Fred MacMurray). 

Phyllis Dietrich, dressed in a black dress with her hair styled in loose curls, is seated at a desk. She holds a small glass ashtray in her hand, her gaze fixed on George Smalley who stands over her. George Smalley, clad in a gray suit and tie, leans over the desk, his attention focused on Phyllis.

The setting is a dimly lit room with a chandelier hanging from the ceiling casting a soft glow. A window can be seen in the background, adding depth to the scene. The overall composition of the image, with its use of lighting, framing, and character positioning, creates a sense of intimacy and danger that is characteristic of the film's genre.

The image is a split-screen still from the movie "Forrest Gump". On the left side of the screen, we see Tom Hanks portraying the character Forrest Gump. He is wearing a gray suit and tie, and he has a surprised expression on his face as he holds a phone to his ear. 

On the right side of the screen, we see Gary Sinise portraying the character Lieutenant Dan Taylor. He is dressed in a white shirt and black pants, and he has a calm demeanor as he sits at a desk with a typewriter in front of him.

The background features a window with blinds partially drawn, suggesting an indoor setting. The overall composition creates a contrast between Forrest's surprise and Lieutenant Dan's composure, reflecting the different experiences and perspectives of their characters.

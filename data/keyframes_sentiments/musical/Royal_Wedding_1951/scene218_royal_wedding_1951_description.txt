Eddie Kaye Thomas, dressed in a black and white checkered suit with a yellow shirt underneath, is positioned on the left side of the frame. He's wearing a white hat and holding a cane in his right hand. On the right side of the frame, Monica Rizzo is seen wearing a red dress adorned with a yellow flower and a pearl necklace. She has her hands placed on her hips. The background features a brick wall with a window and a bookshelf filled with books. The overall composition creates an interesting contrast between the characters' attire and the rustic setting.

In the image, there are two individuals engaged in a dance. The man is dressed in a white military-style uniform adorned with gold epaulettes and a black collar. He is positioned on the left side of the frame, his gaze directed towards the woman.

The woman, on the other hand, is attired in a white ball gown that features a gold sash across her chest. She stands to the right of the man, her attention seemingly focused on him as they move together.

They are situated within a room characterized by blue walls and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The dance floor beneath their feet suggests an indoor setting. The overall scene captures a moment of connection between the two individuals, framed by the opulence of their surroundings.

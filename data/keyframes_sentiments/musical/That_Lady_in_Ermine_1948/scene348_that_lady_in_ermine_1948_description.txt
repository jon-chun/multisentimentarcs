In the image, we see the actor Colin Clive, known for his role as Baron Frankenstein in the film "Frankenstein". He is seated on a throne-like chair, adorned with gold embroidery. His attire consists of a white military jacket with gold epaulettes and a gold chain belt fastened around his waist. A mustache graces his upper lip, adding to his character's distinguished appearance. His gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting deep thought or contemplation. The background features a blue curtain, providing a stark contrast to Clive's white jacket. The image captures a moment of quiet intensity, as Baron Frankenstein seems lost in thought amidst the grandeur of his surroundings.

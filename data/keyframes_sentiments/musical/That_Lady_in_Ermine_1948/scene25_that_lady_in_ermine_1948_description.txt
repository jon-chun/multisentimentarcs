The image presents a scene dominated by two main elements: a large, ornate clock and a statue of a man. The clock, which is the central object in the image, is black with gold accents and features Roman numerals on its face. It's mounted on a wall painted in a light blue color.

To the right of the clock, there's a statue of a man. He appears to be in motion, as if he's reaching out towards something or someone. The statue is also black with gold accents, mirroring the color scheme of the clock.

The positioning of these objects suggests a deliberate arrangement for aesthetic purposes. The clock and the statue are not merely placed next to each other; they seem to interact with each other in this composition.

In terms of lighting, there's a single light source coming from the left side of the image. This light casts shadows on the wall behind the clock and the statue, adding depth and dimension to the scene.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of timelessness and elegance, largely due to the combination of these elements: the ornate design of the clock and statue, their black color with gold accents, the light source casting shadows, and the light blue wall providing a calm backdrop.

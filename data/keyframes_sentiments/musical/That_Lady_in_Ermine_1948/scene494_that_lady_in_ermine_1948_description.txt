In the image, a man and a woman are standing in a room with a window. The man is wearing a black shirt and has a mustache. He is looking at the woman who is dressed in a white dress adorned with black flowers. Her hair is styled into two large braids that fall on her back. The room they are in has a window with curtains, and there's a wooden railing visible as well. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a quiet, introspective moment between the two characters.

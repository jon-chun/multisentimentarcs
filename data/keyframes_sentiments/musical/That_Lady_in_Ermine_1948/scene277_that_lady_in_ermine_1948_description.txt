The image presents a scene dominated by a blue clock with gold accents, which is hanging on a wall. The clock face is white and features black Roman numerals. To the right of the clock, there are three glass candle holders in shades of blue and green. These candle holders are adorned with red flowers.

In addition to these objects, there's also a small statue of a man holding a sword. This statue is located on the left side of the clock. The background of the image is dark, which contrasts with the brightly lit foreground where the clock and candle holders are placed. The overall composition creates an atmosphere that is both intriguing and mysterious.

He's dressed in a blue suit and tie, holding a glass of beer in his hand. Across from him, a man in a white suit and hat stands, seemingly engaged in conversation with Forrest. The room they're in has a window adorned with stained glass, adding a touch of color to the scene. A red chair can be seen in the background, contributing to the overall warm tones of the image.

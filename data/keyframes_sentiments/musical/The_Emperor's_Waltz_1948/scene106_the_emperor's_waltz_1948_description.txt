In the image, a man and a woman are standing in a room adorned with ornate wallpaper. The man is dressed in a black suit and a white hat, while the woman is wearing a long black dress. They are positioned on either side of a small dog that is comfortably seated on the floor between them. The man's gaze is directed towards the camera, giving an impression of engagement with the viewer. On the other hand, the woman's attention seems to be elsewhere, as she is looking away from the camera. The room they are in has a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, adding to the grandeur of the setting. The overall scene suggests a formal or elegant occasion.

The image presents a striking illustration of a bull's head, rendered in black and white. The bull, the central figure of the image, is depicted with its eyes gently closed, suggesting a sense of tranquility or perhaps even contentment. Adding to this serene atmosphere is the bull's nose, which is adorned with a small flower, further enhancing the peaceful ambiance.

The illustration is set against a dark background, which serves to highlight the bull and draw attention to it as the focal point of the image. The artist has skillfully used shading techniques to create depth and dimension in the image, adding a three-dimensional quality to the otherwise two-dimensional representation.

The image does not contain any discernible text or additional objects. The relative position of the bull's head is central, with its eyes closed and nose decorated with a flower at the bottom center of the image. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious, with each element contributing to the serene mood conveyed by the artwork.

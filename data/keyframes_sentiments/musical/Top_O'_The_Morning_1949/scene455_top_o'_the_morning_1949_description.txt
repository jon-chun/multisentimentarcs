This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of historical significance. The image features a horse-drawn carriage, the primary focus of the scene. The carriage is being pulled by two horses, one on each side, their muscles straining as they move forward.

The driver of the carriage is dressed in a formal suit and top hat, his posture upright and confident. He holds the reins firmly, guiding the horses along their path. 

On the sidewalk next to the carriage, there are several people present. Some of them appear to be engaged in conversation with each other, while others seem to be observing the carriage as it passes by.

The setting is a street lined with buildings and trees, providing a backdrop that suggests an urban environment. The absence of color in the photograph adds a timeless quality to the scene, emphasizing the historical context of the image.

The image captures a moment from the movie "Rebecca" featuring Alidina Aliakbarova and Jon Hamm. In this scene, Aliakbarova is seated on a couch with her legs crossed, wearing a blue dress adorned with white ruffles. She holds a hat in her hand, her gaze directed towards Jon Hamm who is standing next to her. He is dressed in a gray suit and tie, his hands casually tucked into his pockets as he looks at Aliakbarova. The setting is a garden, filled with lush green trees under a clear blue sky. The overall composition of the image suggests a casual yet intimate interaction between the two characters.

The background features a window that offers a glimpse into another room, adding depth to the scene. A flag hangs from the ceiling, possibly indicating a significant location within the story.

The overall composition of the image, with its central focus on Dorothy and the surrounding characters, creates a sense of balance and harmony. The use of color, body language, and props all contribute to conveying the emotions and sentiments of the characters in this moment from the movie "Wizard of Oz".

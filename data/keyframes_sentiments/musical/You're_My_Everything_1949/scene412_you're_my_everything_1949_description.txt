In the image, there are three men in a room with a desk and a lamp. The man on the left is wearing a white robe and is standing behind the desk. He has his hands clasped together. In the middle, another man is sitting at the desk. He is wearing a gray suit and has his head resting on his hand. On the right, there is a third man who is also standing. He is dressed in a blue suit and tie. The room they are in has a window with curtains. The colors in the image are mostly neutral, with the exception of the blue suit which stands out. The lighting in the room appears to be dim, adding a sense of intimacy to the scene. The positioning of the men suggests a formal or professional setting.

The image captures a moment between two individuals on a boat. The person on the left, clad in a brown jacket and a white shirt, is smiling at the person on the right, who is wearing a blue shirt. They are both seated on the edge of the boat, with the vast expanse of the ocean stretching out behind them. The sky above them is dark, suggesting it might be evening or night. The image does not contain any text. The overall atmosphere appears to be one of camaraderie and enjoyment of a shared experience.

The image captures a scene on a boat, where two men are the main subjects. The man in the foreground is standing upright, donned in a white hat and a red plaid shirt. He appears to be engaged in conversation with the other man who is seated at a table. 

In the background, there's another individual, this one wearing a brown hat, seemingly engrossed in his own world. The boat they're on has a rustic charm, adorned with dried fish and ropes that hang from the side. 

The setting sun paints the sky in hues of orange, casting long shadows and bathing the scene in a warm glow. The image is devoid of any text or discernible actions beyond what's described. The relative positions of the objects and people suggest a casual, relaxed atmosphere on the boat.

The image captures a scene from the movie "What's Eating Gilbert Grape". In this still, we see Johnny Depp, portraying the character of Gilbert Grape, seated at a wooden table in a room with a window and curtains. He is dressed in a blue shirt and holds a pen in his hand, suggesting he might be writing or drawing. Beside him, an older woman, played by Sissy Spacek, is seen wearing a black dress and holding a glass of water. The image evokes a sense of quiet intensity as the characters engage in what appears to be a deep conversation.

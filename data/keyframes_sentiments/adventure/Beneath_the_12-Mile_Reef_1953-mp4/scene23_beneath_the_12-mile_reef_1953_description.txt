Forrest Gump, dressed in a black suit and hat, is positioned to the left. He is looking towards the right side of the image. His facial expression suggests he is deep in thought.

In the center of the image is Jenny Curran. She is wearing a blue dress and has her arms raised above her head. Her body language indicates she might be expressing joy or excitement.

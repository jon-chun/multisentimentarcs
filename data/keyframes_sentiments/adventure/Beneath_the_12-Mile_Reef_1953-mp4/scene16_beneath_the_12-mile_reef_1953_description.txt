The image captures a moment on a boat, where two men are standing near the edge. The man on the left is donned in a black shirt and a red bandana, while the man on the right is wearing a black jacket with a gold chain. They are both looking out towards the ocean, their gazes directed towards something beyond the frame of the image.

The boat they are standing on has a mast that stands tall in the background, adorned with ropes and other nautical equipment. The sky above them is clear, suggesting it might be a bright day. The water around them mirrors this clarity, its surface calm and undisturbed.

In terms of composition, the two men are positioned towards the right side of the image, leaving space on the left for the boat's mast and other elements. The relative positions of the objects suggest that the viewer's perspective is from someone standing behind the men, looking out at the ocean with them.

There are no discernible texts or countable objects in the image. The overall sentiment of the image seems to be one of contemplation or anticipation, as if the two men are waiting for something significant to happen on the vast expanse of water before them.

In terms of composition, the person's head and torso are positioned centrally within the frame, with their body extending towards the edges of the image. This positioning creates a sense of balance and tension in the scene.

The color palette is dominated by shades of blue-green, which fill most of the background. The only other colors visible are the dark skin tones of the person's face and neck, providing a stark contrast to the surrounding water.

There are no discernible props or costumes in the image, and no text or signage is present. The depth of field is shallow, with the person sharply in focus while the rest of the scene is blurred. This effect further emphasizes the person as the main subject of the image.

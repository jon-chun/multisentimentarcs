The depth of field is shallow, with Forrest in sharp focus and the background blurred, creating a sense of depth and movement. The visual effects and post-processing have been used to enhance the dramatic effect of the scene, making it appear as though the viewer is right there in the stormy sea with Forrest Gump.

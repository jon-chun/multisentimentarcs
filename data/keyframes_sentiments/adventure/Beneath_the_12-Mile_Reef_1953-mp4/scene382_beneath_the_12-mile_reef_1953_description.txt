The image captures a scene from the movie "Jumanji: The Next Level". In the center of the frame, actor Dwayne Johnson is seen swimming in a pool. He's wearing a vibrant red shirt that stands out against the blue-green water. His body language suggests he's in motion, possibly moving through the water with some force.

The camera angle is from above and slightly to the side, giving us a clear view of Johnson's face and upper body. The lighting is diffused, softening the overall look of the image and reducing harsh shadows.

In the background, there's a boat visible on the right side of the frame, adding an element of intrigue to the scene. The boat's presence suggests that this could be a pool or a large lake.

The color palette of the image is dominated by shades of blue-green from the water, contrasted with Johnson's red shirt and the darker blue of the boat in the background. This combination creates a visually striking image.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of adventure and excitement, fitting for a scene from an action-packed movie like "Jumanji: The Next Level".

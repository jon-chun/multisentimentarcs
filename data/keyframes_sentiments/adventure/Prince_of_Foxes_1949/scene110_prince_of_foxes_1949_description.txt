This is a black and white photograph capturing a scene from the 1967 film "The Dirty Dozen". The central figure in the image is Lee Marvin, portraying the character of Colonel John Matrix. He stands on a boat, his body clad in a leather tunic and a helmet adorned with a feather. In his hand, he holds a sword, its blade gleaming even in the monochrome palette of the photograph.

To Marvin's right, another figure can be seen lying on the deck of the boat, a rifle held loosely in their grasp. The boat itself is moored to a dock, which extends into the distance where it meets a line of trees and shrubs. The entire scene is steeped in an air of tension and anticipation, a testament to the dramatic narrative that unfolds within "The Dirty Dozen".

The stone building behind them features arched windows, adding an architectural element to the scene. A crowd of people can be seen in the background, suggesting that this might be a public event or gathering.

The photograph is taken from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene and emphasizing the relative positions of the individuals and their surroundings. The lighting appears natural, with no artificial sources visible, indicating it might be daytime.

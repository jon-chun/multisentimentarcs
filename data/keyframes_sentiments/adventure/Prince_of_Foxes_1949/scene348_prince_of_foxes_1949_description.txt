This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Rebecca". The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the characters. The central figure is Alfonse Llach, portraying the character of Sam Radlett. He stands in front of a large mirror, his face etched with concern as he gazes into it. Behind him, three women are present - Rosamund Pike as Mrs Danvers, Laurence Olivier as Mrs Van Roy, and Diana Dandridge as the title character Rebecca. They all stand behind Alfonse Llach, their attention seemingly focused on him. The room they're in is ornate, with a high ceiling and arches adorning the walls. A large painting hangs prominently on the wall. The photograph is rich in detail, from the characters' expressions to the architectural elements of the room.

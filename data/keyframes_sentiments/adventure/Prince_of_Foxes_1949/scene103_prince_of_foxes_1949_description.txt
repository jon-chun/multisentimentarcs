This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Man Who Knew Too Much". The image captures a tense moment between two characters, one of whom is holding a gun. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and hat, has a determined look on his face as he points the gun at the other man. The second man, wearing a robe, looks surprised and is looking to the right. The setting is a room with a fireplace and a mirror in the background. The monochrome color scheme adds to the dramatic effect of the scene.

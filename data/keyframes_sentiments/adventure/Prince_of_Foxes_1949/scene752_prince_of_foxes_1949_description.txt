He is captured in a close-up shot, his face turned slightly to the side as he gazes into the distance with a look of concern etched on his features. His attire consists of a black beret adorned with a gold emblem, a patterned vest, and a ruffled collar, adding an air of sophistication to his character. The background is shrouded in darkness, with only a faint hint of a building discernible in the top left corner, further emphasizing the actor's presence in the frame.

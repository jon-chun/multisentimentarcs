The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of tranquility. A hand, holding a pen, is in the process of writing on a piece of paper that rests on an open book. The text being written reads "To Peace", followed by the names of various individuals including "John", "Mary", "David", "Paul", "Judy", and "Orange Boy". The background is blurred, drawing focus to the hand, pen, and paper in the foreground. The monochrome palette adds a timeless quality to the scene.

His attire consists of a suit adorned with chains, adding to the comedic and dramatic effect of the scene.

Chaplin's facial expression is one of surprise or shock, evident from his wide-eyed look and slightly open mouth. This expression, combined with his body language and gestures, suggests that he has just experienced an unexpected event or revelation.

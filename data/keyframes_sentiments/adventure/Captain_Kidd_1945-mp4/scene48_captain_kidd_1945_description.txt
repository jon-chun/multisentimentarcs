This is a black and white photograph capturing a dramatic scene from the movie "The Grand Budapest Hotel". The image is taken from a low angle, focusing on the character Agatha, who is kneeling down to trim another character's hair. Agatha is dressed in a white blouse adorned with a black collar and cuffs, paired with a black skirt. She holds a pair of scissors in her hand, poised over the other character's head.

The other character, a man, is seated on a chair. He is wearing a black suit and a white shirt, and he gazes off to the side with a pensive expression. The setting appears to be an opulent hotel lobby, characterized by ornate decorations and a grand staircase in the background. The overall composition of the image suggests a narrative filled with tension and intrigue.

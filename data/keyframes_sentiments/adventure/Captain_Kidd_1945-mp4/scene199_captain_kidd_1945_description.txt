This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Great Gatsby". The scene unfolds in a room adorned with curtains, under a chandelier that hangs from the ceiling. 

In the center of the frame, three men are engaged in conversation around a table draped with a white tablecloth. One man, distinguished by his black suit and top hat, stands on the left side of the table. He holds a glass of champagne in his hand, perhaps toasting to an occasion or simply enjoying the company.

On the right side of the table, another man is seen wearing a white suit and holding a tray filled with glasses of champagne. His posture suggests he might be serving the drinks or waiting for someone.

The third man, dressed in a black suit similar to the first man's, stands behind the table. He holds a glass of champagne as well, indicating his participation in the conversation.

The chandelier casts light on the scene, adding depth and dimension to the room. The curtains frame the scene, drawing attention to the interaction between the three men.

Overall, this image captures an intimate moment among friends, set against the backdrop of opulence and sophistication that is characteristic of "The Great Gatsby".

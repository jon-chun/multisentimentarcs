The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in a room. The person on the left, donned in a white shirt and a bandana, stands slightly behind the other individual who is wearing a patterned headscarf and a dark-colored dress. They are positioned in front of a mirror, which reflects their image back at them. The room they are in has a window that lets in light, illuminating the scene. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a sense of intimacy and shared experience between the two individuals.

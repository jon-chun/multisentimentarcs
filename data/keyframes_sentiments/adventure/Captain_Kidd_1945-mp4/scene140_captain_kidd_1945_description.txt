This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Great Dictator". The image features three men, each with distinct expressions and attire.

In the foreground, a man in a suit and top hat is holding a feather duster. His posture suggests he is in the midst of dusting an object or surface. 

Behind him, two men are present. One is dressed in a suit and tie, while the other sports a black shirt and tie. Their expressions and body language hint at tension or disagreement between them.

The setting appears to be a room with a window and a coat rack visible in the background. The monochrome palette of the photograph adds a timeless quality to the scene.

On either side of him sit two women, both elegantly dressed in long gowns and hats. They are seated on ornate chairs, their posture upright and dignified. Their presence adds a sense of formality and grandeur to the scene.

The room itself is richly decorated with intricate patterns and designs, reflecting the opulence of the era. The portrait of Queen Elizabeth I looms in the background, adding a historical context to the image.

Overall, this photograph evokes a sense of history, elegance, and importance, capturing a moment from "The Crown" that tells a story of its own.

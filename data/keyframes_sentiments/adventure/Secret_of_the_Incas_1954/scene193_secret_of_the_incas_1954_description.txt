In the image, a scene from a movie is captured. The main focus is on three individuals: two women and one man. They are seated in a room with a wooden floor and white walls. 

The woman on the left is elegantly dressed in a brown coat, her hair styled in loose curls that fall gently around her shoulders. She holds a glass of champagne delicately in her hand, suggesting a celebratory atmosphere.

In the center, another woman is seen wearing a vibrant red dress. Her black hair contrasts with the lighter tones of the room and her companions' attire. Like the first woman, she too holds a glass of champagne, indicating they are both partaking in the same toast or celebration.

On the right, a man is seated. He is dressed in a blue shirt and his dark hair is neatly styled. Unlike the women, he does not hold a glass of champagne, perhaps suggesting he is not participating in the celebration at this moment.

The room they are in has wooden chairs scattered around, adding to the warm and inviting ambiance. The white walls provide a neutral backdrop that allows the colorful attire of the individuals to stand out.

Overall, the image captures a moment of camaraderie and celebration among friends or acquaintances, with the act of holding champagne glasses suggesting a shared joyous occasion.

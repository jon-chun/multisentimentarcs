The image captures a moment from the movie "A River Runs Through It" featuring three characters: Paul C. Cooney, Tom Skandia, and Brad Pitt. They are standing in front of a backdrop that includes trees and mountains under a blue sky with clouds.

1. Paul C. Cooney is dressed in a white shirt, a red tie, and gray pants. He has his arms crossed over his chest.
2. Tom Skandia is wearing a green shirt and khaki pants. He stands with his hands on his hips.
3. Brad Pitt is seen in a blue shirt and jeans. He has his hands tucked into his pockets.

The characters are positioned in the center of the frame, with Paul C. Cooney on the left, Tom Skandia in the middle, and Brad Pitt on the right. The trees and mountains form the background, while the blue sky with clouds fills the top part of the image. The overall composition creates a sense of balance and harmony among the characters and their surroundings.

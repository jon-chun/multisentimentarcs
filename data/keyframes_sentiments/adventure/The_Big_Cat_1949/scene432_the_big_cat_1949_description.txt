In the image, a man and a woman are standing in front of a rocky hillside. The man is positioned on the right side of the frame, wearing a plaid shirt with a collar that's slightly askew. He has dark hair and is looking off to the left. On the left side of the frame, there's a woman dressed in a blue dress with white polka dots. She is looking up at the man, her gaze meeting his. The overall scene suggests a moment of interaction between the two characters, set against the backdrop of a rugged landscape.

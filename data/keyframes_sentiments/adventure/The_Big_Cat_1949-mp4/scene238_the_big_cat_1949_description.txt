In the image, there are two men standing in a room with a window and curtains. The man on the left is wearing a white shirt and has a pipe in his mouth. He is looking to the right. The man on the right is wearing a plaid shirt and is looking directly at the camera. The room they are in has a window with curtains, suggesting it might be daytime outside. The lighting in the room appears to be natural, coming from the window. The overall atmosphere of the image seems calm and relaxed.

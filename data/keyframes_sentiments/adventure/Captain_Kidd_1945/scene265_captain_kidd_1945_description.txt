This is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The image captures a moment between two characters, Rick Blaine (played by Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (played by Ingrid Bergman), in a room with a window and a bookshelf in the background.

Rick Blaine is standing on the left side of the frame. He is dressed in a white shirt and black pants, holding a glass of water in his hand. His facial expression is one of concern as he looks at Ilsa.

Ilsa Lund is sitting on the right side of the frame. She is wearing a white blouse and black pants, with a red scarf draped around her neck. Her gaze is directed towards Rick, and she has a pensive look on her face.

The room they are in has a window on the left wall and a bookshelf on the right wall. The lighting in the room is dim, adding to the dramatic effect of the scene. The overall composition of the image suggests an intense conversation between the two characters.

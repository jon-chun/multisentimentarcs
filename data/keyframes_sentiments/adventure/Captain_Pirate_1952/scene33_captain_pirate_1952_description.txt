In the image, there are two men standing side by side in a room. The man on the left is dressed in a brown coat with gold trim and a white cravat. He has dark hair and is looking off to the right. The man on the right is wearing a purple coat with gold trim and a black cravat. He has light-colored hair and is looking directly at the camera. Both men are holding a small object in their hands, which appears to be a key or a set of keys. The room they are in has a window visible in the background.

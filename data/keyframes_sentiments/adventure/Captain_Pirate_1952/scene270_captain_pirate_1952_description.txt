In the image, a woman is seated at a table in what appears to be a room with a blue wall and a window. She is dressed in a purple blouse and a red skirt, and she holds a gold jar in her hands. The table before her is adorned with several objects: a silver goblet, a clear glass decanter filled with red wine, and a small statue of a man. The woman's gaze is directed to the side, suggesting that she might be lost in thought or observing something outside the frame. The overall scene suggests a quiet moment of contemplation or introspection.

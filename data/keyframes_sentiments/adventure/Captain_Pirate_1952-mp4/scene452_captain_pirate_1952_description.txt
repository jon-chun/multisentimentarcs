The setting is a stone courtyard, its rugged texture contrasting with the smooth fabric of their attire. A fire burns brightly in the background, casting an ominous glow that illuminates the scene. The relative positions of the men suggest they are at odds, their swords crossed in a silent duel.

The color palette is dominated by shades of blue and black, reflecting the starkness of the conflict unfolding. The stone courtyard provides a neutral backdrop, its gray hues blending seamlessly with the darkness of the night sky above.

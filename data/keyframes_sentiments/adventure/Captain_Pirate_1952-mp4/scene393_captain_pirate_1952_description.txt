He is dressed in a blue coat adorned with gold trim and a white cravat. A tricorn hat rests on his head, adding to his pirate attire. His face carries a concerned expression as he gazes off to the side, suggesting an impending danger or task at hand. The setting is a dark cave, illuminated by torches that cast a warm glow on the scene. In the background, stalactites hang from the ceiling, and a large boulder can be seen, adding to the ruggedness of the cave environment. The image does not contain any text.

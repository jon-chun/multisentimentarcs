In the image, there are four individuals in a room with a blue wall and a window. The man on the left is dressed in a red coat and a black tricorn hat, standing tall with his hands resting at his sides. In the center of the frame, a woman is seen wearing a white dress, her arms crossed over her chest. To the right, another man is clad in a blue coat and a white wig, mirroring the stance of the man on the left. Behind these three individuals, partially obscured by them, stands a fourth person, also dressed in a red coat and a black tricorn hat like the first man. The room they are in has a wooden floor and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling.

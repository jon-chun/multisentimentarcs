In the image, there are two men standing in a room with a red door and a white wall. The man on the left is wearing a red fez hat and an orange vest over a black shirt. He has his hands on his hips and is looking to the right. The man on the right is dressed in a blue coat adorned with gold epaulettes, a red feathered hat, and a red sash. He is holding a silver goblet in his hand and looking to the left. Both men are positioned slightly off-center from each other, creating a sense of space between them. The room they are in has a simple yet elegant design with its white walls and red door. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a formal or ceremonial occasion.

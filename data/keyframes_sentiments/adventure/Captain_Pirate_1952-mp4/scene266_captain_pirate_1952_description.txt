In the image, a woman is seated at a table in what appears to be a room with a window and a statue. She is wearing a purple blouse and a gold necklace. In her hand, she holds a glass of wine. On the table in front of her are two decanters, one red and one clear. The red decanter has a lid on it. The woman's facial expression suggests that she is surprised or startled by something off-camera. The overall setting and elements in the image suggest a scene from a movie or TV show.

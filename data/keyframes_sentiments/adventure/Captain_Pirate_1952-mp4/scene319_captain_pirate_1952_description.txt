In the center of the image stands a young man. He's wearing a blue and red uniform with gold trimmings, indicating he might be an employee of the hotel. His stance is confident and assertive as he holds a sword in his hand.

On the right, another older man is seated on a wooden chair. He's dressed in a black suit, providing a stark contrast to the colorful scene around him. His gaze seems to be directed towards something or someone outside the frame of the image.

The room itself is filled with various objects that add to its charm. A desk can be seen in the background, along with a lamp and a vase. The chandelier hanging from the ceiling adds an element of elegance to the scene.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of intrigue and mystery, characteristic of the film's narrative. The precise positioning of the characters and objects, along with their actions and expressions, contribute to the complexity and depth of the scene.

He is dressed in a brown leather jacket and a red bandana, holding a sword in his hand. To his right, there's another character played by Jack Sparrow, who is wearing a white shirt with a blue sash and a black tricorn hat. On Skarsgård's left, we see Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, dressed in a black leather jacket and a red bandana similar to Skarsgård's outfit. The characters are standing on a sandy beach, surrounded by palm trees under a clear blue sky. The overall composition of the image suggests an adventurous and thrilling narrative typical of the "Pirates of Carribean" franchise.

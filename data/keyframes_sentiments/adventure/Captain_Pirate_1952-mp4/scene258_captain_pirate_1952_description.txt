The character on the left is donned in a brown coat and a black hat, while the one on the right is wearing a purple dress and a gold necklace. The table between them holds a bottle of wine and a candle.

The overall color palette of the image is dominated by shades of brown, purple, and black. The characters' body language suggests an intense conversation or negotiation taking place at the table.

The lighting in the image is dim, adding to the dramatic atmosphere of the scene. The use of depth of field is noticeable, with the characters and objects in the foreground appearing sharp and clear, while those in the background are slightly blurred.

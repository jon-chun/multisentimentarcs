In the image, there are three men in a room with a green door and a window. The man on the left is dressed in a blue suit and hat, standing upright with his hands clasped behind his back. He appears to be engaged in conversation with the other two men.

The man in the middle is wearing a white coat and has his arms crossed over his chest. His posture suggests he might be listening or observing the conversation between the other two men.

On the right, there's another man who is wearing a red shirt and a hat. He is kneeling down next to a box of papers, seemingly engrossed in reading something from the box.

The room they are in has a green door and a window with white curtains. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a formal or professional setting.

He is dressed in a beige shirt and brown pants, holding a sword in his right hand. His facial expression is serious as he looks off to the side.

Behind him, there are four other characters: three men and one woman. The man on the far left is wearing a red coat and has a white beard. Next to him, there's another man dressed in a blue coat. On the far right, there's a woman in a pink dress. All of them appear to be looking at Bootstrap Bill Turner.

The setting is a ship with wooden planks visible on the floor. The lighting is dim, and the color palette consists mainly of shades of brown and beige. The characters' body language and gestures suggest a tense moment in the scene. The props and costumes are consistent with the period setting of the movie. The depth of field is shallow, focusing on Bootstrap Bill Turner while the other characters are slightly blurred in the background.

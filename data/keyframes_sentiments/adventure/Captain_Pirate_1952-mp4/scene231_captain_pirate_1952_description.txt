In the image, actor Colin Farrell is seated at a desk in a room with blue walls. He's dressed in a white suit and has a look of concern on his face as he gazes at another person standing behind him. The person standing behind him is wearing a red wig and a blue coat adorned with gold trim. They are holding a black bird in their hand. On the desk, there are three lit candles casting a warm glow on Colin's face. The overall scene suggests a tense or dramatic moment from a movie or TV show.

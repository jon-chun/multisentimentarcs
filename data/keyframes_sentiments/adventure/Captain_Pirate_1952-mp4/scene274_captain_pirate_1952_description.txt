She has a gold necklace around her neck and she's wearing earrings that match her necklace. Her facial expression is one of laughter, adding a joyful atmosphere to the scene.

The room she's in has a white wall which serves as the backdrop for various objects. There are several figurines displayed on the wall, each unique in size and shape. A red curtain hangs from the ceiling, matching the parrot's vibrant color.

The image captures a dramatic scene from the movie "The Great Gatsby". The room is dimly lit, creating an atmosphere of intrigue and suspense. At the center of the frame, three men are engaged in what appears to be a tense conversation.

On the left, a man dressed in a vibrant red coat stands out against the muted colors of the room. His white cravat adds a touch of elegance to his attire. He holds a yellow candle in his hand, its flame flickering softly in the dim light.

In the middle, another man is clad in a brown suit, complemented by a white cravat and a gold chain belt that glints subtly in the low light. His posture suggests he is actively participating in the conversation.

On the right, a third man is seen wearing a purple coat with a gold chain belt. He holds a yellow candle similar to the first man's, their candles casting long shadows on the wall behind them.

The background features a window draped with curtains and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, adding to the opulence of the setting. The positioning of the men and their props suggests a narrative unfolding, with each element contributing to the overall mood and atmosphere of the scene.

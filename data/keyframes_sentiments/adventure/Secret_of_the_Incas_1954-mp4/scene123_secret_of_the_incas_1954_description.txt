He has his hands tucked into his pockets and he's looking to the right with a slight smile on his face. On the right, another man is dressed in a gray suit and a white fedora hat. He's looking to the left with a neutral expression. The background of the image features a sign that reads "DINER AMERICANA". The overall scene suggests a casual, relaxed atmosphere.

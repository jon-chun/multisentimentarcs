The image captures a moment from the movie "Labyrinth: The Power of the Dog". In the center of the frame, three women are adorned in traditional Indian attire. Their outfits are a vibrant mix of pink and red, with intricate embroidery adding to their cultural richness. They each hold a large umbrella, its red canopy contrasting against the backdrop.

In the image, there are three men standing in front of a large rock formation. The man on the left is wearing a red and white striped shirt and a pink hat with a feather sticking out of it. He is holding a small object in his hand. In the middle, there is another man dressed in a green jacket and a black hat. On the right, the third man is seen wearing a red cape and a matching red hat with a feather on top. The rock formation behind them has a tree growing out of it. The image captures a moment of interaction between the three men, possibly suggesting a scene from a movie or a play.

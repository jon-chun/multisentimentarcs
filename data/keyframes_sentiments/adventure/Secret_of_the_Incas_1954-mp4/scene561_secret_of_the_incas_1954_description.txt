In the image, we see a scene from the movie "Mildred" featuring actress Bette Davis. She is positioned on the left side of the frame, dressed in a vibrant red and white dress that stands out against the dark background. Her hair is styled in loose curls, adding to her classic look. On the right side of the image, we see James Cagney, portraying the character of Ben Diamond. He is attired in a brown suit complemented by a blue tie, providing a stark contrast to Davis's colorful attire. The setting appears to be a dimly lit room with stone walls and arches, enhancing the dramatic effect of the scene. The overall composition of the image suggests an intense interaction between the two characters.

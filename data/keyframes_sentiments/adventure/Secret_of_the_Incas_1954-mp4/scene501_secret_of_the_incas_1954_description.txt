In the image, there are two men standing side by side in front of a stone wall. The man on the left is dressed in a brown leather jacket adorned with a white scarf and a round patch on his left arm. He has dark hair and is looking off to the right. On the right, another man is wearing a beige fedora hat and a blue shirt layered over a purple sweater. He too is looking off to the right. The stone wall behind them features a large archway with vines growing through it, adding an element of nature to the scene. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a casual, relaxed setting.

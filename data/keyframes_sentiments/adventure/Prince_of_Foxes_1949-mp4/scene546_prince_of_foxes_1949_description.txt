In the black and white photograph, a man and a woman are standing in front of a throne. The man is positioned on the left side of the frame, dressed in a medieval outfit complete with a helmet adorned with a plume. His stance is upright, suggesting a sense of authority or nobility.

On the right side of the frame, a woman is seen wearing a dress that features a high collar and long sleeves, indicative of a bygone era. Her gaze is directed towards the camera, adding an element of engagement to the scene.

The throne behind them serves as a focal point in the image, its ornate design hinting at a royal or aristocratic setting. The positioning of the man and woman in front of the throne suggests they are of high status or importance.

The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the photograph, enhancing the historical context suggested by the medieval outfits and the throne. The absence of color also draws attention to the textures and patterns within the image, from the plume on the man's helmet to the intricate details of the woman's dress.

Overall, the film-maker has used various elements - facial expressions, camera angles, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, costumes, depth of field, character positioning, visual effects, and post-processing - to create a scene that evokes a sense of history and nobility.

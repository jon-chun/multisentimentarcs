The image features two main characters, Colin Firth portraying the character of King George VI and Nicole Kidman playing the role of Queen Elizabeth. They are positioned in front of a throne, with Firth standing to the left and Kidman sitting on the right. Firth is dressed in a medieval knight's armor, complete with a helmet adorned with a plume. Kidman is attired in a black dress, accentuated by a pearl necklace. The backdrop is a stone wall, embellished with a coat of arms. The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the characters, adding to the grandeur and majesty of the scene.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a surreal scene. The image features two main subjects: a cat and a skull, both of which are perched on a railing.

The cat, positioned on the left side of the frame, is facing towards the right. It's adorned with a hat and holds a cane in its paws, adding to the whimsical nature of the scene.

On the right side of the image, we see a skull. This isn't just any ordinary skull though - it has been anthropomorphized with arms and legs, giving it an almost human-like quality. The skull is also facing towards the right, mirroring the cat's direction.

The background of the image reveals a building adorned with a mural, further enhancing the surreal atmosphere of the photograph. Despite being in black and white, the image is rich in detail and evokes a sense of curiosity and wonder.

The image is a black and white movie still featuring two men. The man in the foreground, who appears to be of European descent, is wearing a triangular piratine's hat with a feather adorning it. He is also wearing a necklace that holds a small pendant. His facial expression is one of concern or worry.

In the background, there is another man who seems to be of African descent. He is wearing a round pirate's hat and has a mustache. The two men are positioned in front of a wall with a window and a painting hanging on it. The overall composition of the image suggests a narrative that involves these two characters, possibly set in a historical or colonial context given their attire and expressions.

The image is a black and white still from the movie "The Princess Bride". In the center of the frame, we see Westley (played by Cary Elwes) sitting on a wooden chair with his legs crossed. He's wearing a white shirt adorned with a red rose and a black hat. To his right, Buttercup (played by Robin Wright Penn) is seated on a bench. She's dressed in a green dress and has her hands resting on her knees. The setting appears to be an indoor room with a brick wall visible in the background. A wooden dresser can also be seen behind them. The overall composition of the image suggests a quiet, intimate moment between the two characters.

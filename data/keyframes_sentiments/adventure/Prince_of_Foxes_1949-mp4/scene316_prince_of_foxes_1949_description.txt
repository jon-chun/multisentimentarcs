The setting appears to be an urban environment, possibly a city street, characterized by buildings and signs visible in the background. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to the scene, emphasizing the stark contrast between the crowd and their surroundings.

As for the sentiment or emotions evoked by the film-maker's elements, it's difficult to determine without color information.

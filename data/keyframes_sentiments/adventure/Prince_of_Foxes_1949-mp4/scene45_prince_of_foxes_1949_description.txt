The image is a black and white movie still featuring two individuals in a room. The man on the left, who is closer to the camera, is wearing a patterned shirt and has dark hair. He appears to be looking at the woman on the right with a concerned expression. The woman, who is further away from the camera, is dressed in a white dress adorned with a black flower. She seems to be looking back at him. The room they are in has a tiled floor and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a tense or serious moment between the two characters.

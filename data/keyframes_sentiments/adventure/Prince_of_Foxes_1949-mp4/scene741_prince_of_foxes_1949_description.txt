The image is a black and white movie still featuring actress Natalie Portman. She is positioned in front of a brick wall, her head tilted slightly to the side as she gazes off to the side with a pensive expression. Her attire consists of a scarf draped over her shoulders and a jacket fastened at the waist with a brooch. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to the scene.

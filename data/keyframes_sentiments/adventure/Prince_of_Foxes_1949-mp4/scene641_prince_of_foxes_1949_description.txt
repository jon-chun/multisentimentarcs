The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of quiet intensity. The central figure is a man, seated on a throne-like chair that suggests a position of authority or power. His attire consists of a robe adorned with intricate patterns, adding to the overall grandeur of the scene.

In his left hand, he holds a necklace, perhaps symbolic of his status or role. His gaze is directed off to the side, and his expression is serious, hinting at deep thought or contemplation.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the man, which further emphasizes his stature and dominance in the scene. The background features a wall with intricate carvings, adding depth and complexity to the setting.

Despite being a black and white image, the contrast between light and dark areas creates a sense of drama and tension. The absence of color focuses the viewer's attention on the man and his actions, rather than being distracted by colors.

Overall, the film-maker has used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and costumes to create a powerful and evocative image. The use of black and white adds a timeless quality to the photograph, enhancing its emotional impact.

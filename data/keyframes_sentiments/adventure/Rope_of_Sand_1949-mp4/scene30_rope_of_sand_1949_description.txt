This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a dock. The main subjects are two men, one dressed in a light-colored shirt and the other in dark clothing. They are standing near a large metal structure that has a ladder on its side. This structure appears to be part of a larger building with a corrugated metal roof.

The man in the light-colored shirt is actively engaged in an action, as he is holding onto the ladder of the metal structure. His posture suggests he might be climbing or descending the ladder. The other man, dressed in dark clothing, stands nearby, observing the scene.

In the background, there's a crane and another building with a similar corrugated metal roof, indicating that this location could be an industrial area. The overall composition of the image suggests a working environment where manual labor is involved.

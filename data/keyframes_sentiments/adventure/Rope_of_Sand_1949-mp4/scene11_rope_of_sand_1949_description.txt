This is a black and white photograph capturing a scene on a sandy beach. The main subjects of the image are two individuals, one clad in a white shirt and shorts, and the other in a black shirt and pants. They appear to be engaged in some form of activity or sport, as suggested by their body language.

In addition to the people, there is also a police car present in the scene. The car is positioned on the left side of the image, facing towards the right. This could suggest that it's either patrolling the area or responding to an incident nearby.

The beach itself is sandy and appears to be quite expansive. In the background, you can see sand dunes, adding a sense of depth and scale to the image. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a dynamic and active scene unfolding on this sandy beach.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of leisure and relaxation. The main focus of the image is a table, covered with a dark cloth, which serves as the stage for this scene.

On the table, there are two stacks of poker chips, one red and one green, suggesting an ongoing or recently concluded game. The chips are neatly stacked, indicating that the game has been played with care and attention to detail.

In addition to the poker chips, there is a deck of playing cards on the table. The cards are spread out, perhaps in preparation for another round of betting or after a successful hand.

A person's hand is visible in the image, holding a cigarette. This could suggest that the person is taking a break from the game or simply enjoying their time at the table.

The background of the image is blurred and indistinct, drawing attention back to the main elements on the table. The overall composition of the image suggests a quiet moment of solitude and enjoyment in the midst of a friendly poker game.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of solitude in an urban setting. The main subject is a person, dressed in casual attire consisting of a t-shirt and jeans, sitting on the edge of a building ledge. Their legs are crossed at the knee, with their left hand resting on their right knee, suggesting a relaxed posture.

The background features a dark sky, adding to the overall somber mood of the image. The cityscape is faintly visible in the distance, providing context to the location but not detracting from the main subject.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the person's face and upper body. This perspective emphasizes the person's presence and draws attention to their facial expression, which appears to be neutral or contemplative.

The lighting in the image is dramatic, with the person being the only source of light in the frame. The contrast between the lit subject and the dark background creates a strong visual impact.

In terms of composition, the person is positioned on the left side of the frame, leaving much of the right side empty. This choice of framing further emphasizes the person as the focal point of the image.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, and composition to create a powerful and evocative scene that captures a quiet moment in an urban setting.

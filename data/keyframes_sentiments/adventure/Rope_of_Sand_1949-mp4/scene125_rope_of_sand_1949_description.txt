The image captures a scene from the movie "A Streetcar Named Desire" featuring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. In this black and white photo, Marlon Brando, dressed in a white suit and tie, stands on the left side of the frame. He is holding a glass of water in his hand, his gaze directed towards Al Pacino who is standing on the right side of the frame. Al Pacino, wearing a gray suit and tie, looks back at Marlon Brando with a slight smile on his face. The setting appears to be a room with a window visible in the background.

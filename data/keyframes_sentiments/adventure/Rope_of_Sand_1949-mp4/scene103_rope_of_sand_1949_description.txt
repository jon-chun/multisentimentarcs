This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a bar. The main focus of the image is on two men, one seated at the bar and the other standing behind it. 

The man seated at the bar is wearing a hat and appears to be engaged in conversation with the bartender. His body language suggests he is relaxed and enjoying his time at the bar.

The bartender, standing behind the counter, is dressed in a white shirt and black pants. He is attentively looking at the customer, indicating that he is providing good service.

The setting of the image is a typical bar, complete with a counter, bottles, and glasses on it. The lighting in the image is dim, adding to the ambiance of the scene.

In terms of composition, the photographer has positioned the two men as the main subjects, with the bartender slightly off-center behind the seated man. This gives depth to the image and draws attention to both characters.

On the right, another man, wearing a military uniform, stands behind the seated man. His posture suggests he is observing or waiting for something. The background features bookshelves filled with books and a window, adding to the office ambiance. The overall composition of the image, along with the contrasting attire of the two men, creates an intriguing narrative about their relationship and roles within this setting.

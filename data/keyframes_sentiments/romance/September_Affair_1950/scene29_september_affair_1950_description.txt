This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of three individuals seated around a table. The table, draped in a white tablecloth, serves as the central focus of the image. On it, two wine glasses are visible, one on each side of the table.

The individual on the left, dressed in a light-colored dress, is holding a fork and appears to be in the midst of a meal. The person in the middle, wearing a dark-colored shirt paired with a tie, also holds a fork but seems to be looking at the other two individuals. The third person, on the right, is clad in a black dress and is holding a wine glass.

The background features a window that offers a view of trees outside, adding an element of nature to the scene. The overall composition suggests a social gathering or meal shared among friends or family.

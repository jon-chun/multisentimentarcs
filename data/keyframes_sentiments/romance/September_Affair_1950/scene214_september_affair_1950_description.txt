The image is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The scene takes place in a garden, with three main characters: Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), and Sam (Dooley Wilson). 

Rick Blaine, standing on the left side of the frame, is dressed in a white shirt and dark pants. He is looking towards the right side of the frame where Ilsa Lund is standing. Ilsa is wearing a black dress and appears to be engaged in conversation with Rick.

On the right side of the frame, Sam is sitting down. He is wearing a white shirt and dark pants similar to Rick's. His attention seems to be focused on something or someone outside the frame.

The garden setting includes a bench and a lamppost visible in the background. The lighting in the scene suggests it might be evening. The overall composition of the image creates a sense of tension and anticipation, characteristic of the film's genre as a classic romantic drama.

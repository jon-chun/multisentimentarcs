This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two women in a library setting. The woman on the left, dressed in a dark-colored dress, is seated at a desk, her attention focused on the other woman. The woman on the right, wearing a light-colored dress and a hat, stands behind the desk, her gaze meeting that of the seated woman.

The desk between them holds a telephone and a book, suggesting an air of intellectual pursuit or perhaps a conversation about literature. The background is filled with bookshelves, further emphasizing the library setting. The lighting in the room is dim, creating a sense of intimacy between the two women.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the women, which adds to the dramatic effect and draws attention to their expressions and body language. Despite being a still image, it conveys a sense of motion and interaction between the two women.

Please note that as this is a black and white photograph, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the contrast between light and dark clothing helps in distinguishing between the two women and their surroundings. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a narrative open to interpretation, inviting viewers to speculate about the conversation taking place between the two women.

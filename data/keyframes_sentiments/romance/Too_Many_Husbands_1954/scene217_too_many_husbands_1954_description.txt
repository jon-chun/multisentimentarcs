In the foreground, we see two men seated at a desk. One man is dressed in a suit, while the other is wearing a tuxedo. Their expressions are serious, indicating an intense conversation or discussion taking place.

Standing behind them is a woman, elegantly dressed in a black coat and hat. She holds a book in her hand, suggesting she might be reading or about to read. Her position behind the two men gives her a commanding presence in the scene.

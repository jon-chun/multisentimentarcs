This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Pulp Fiction". The image features three main characters: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman.

John Travolta, dressed in a black suit and tie, is seated on a couch. His facial expression is one of concern as he looks at Samuel L. Jackson.

Samuel L. Jackson, wearing a white shirt adorned with blue polka dots, is also seated on the couch. He is looking at John Travolta, his face reflecting an intense gaze.

Uma Thurman stands in the background, dressed in a long white dress. She is looking at Samuel L. Jackson, her expression unreadable from this angle.

The setting appears to be a living room, with a couch and curtains visible in the background. The monochrome color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene. The characters' body language and gestures suggest tension between them, hinting at the complex dynamics of their relationships within the film.

A woman stands near them, her attention directed towards the man sitting on the couch. Her posture indicates she is listening intently to his words.

The coffee table holds a book and a vase, adding to the homely atmosphere of the scene. The book's presence might suggest that one or more of the individuals in the room are avid readers.

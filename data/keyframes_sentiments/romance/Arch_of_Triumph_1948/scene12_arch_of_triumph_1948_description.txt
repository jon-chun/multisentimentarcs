The image is a black and white movie still featuring two men in military uniforms. The man on the left, donned in a dark uniform with a peaked cap, stands behind the other man who is wearing a light-colored shirt with a collar. Both men are looking off to the right side of the frame, their gazes directed towards something or someone outside the frame. The background is blurred, drawing focus to the two men and their expressions. The overall mood of the image suggests a serious and solemn atmosphere.

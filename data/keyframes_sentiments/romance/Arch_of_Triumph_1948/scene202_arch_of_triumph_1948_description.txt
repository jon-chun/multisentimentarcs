This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals. The man, positioned on the left side of the frame, is holding a glass in his hand. His gaze is directed towards the woman on the right side of the image. The woman, dressed in a black dress adorned with a pearl necklace, reciprocates his gaze. They are seated against a backdrop of a white curtain and a wall, which also features a window. The monochrome palette of the photograph adds a timeless quality to this intimate scene.

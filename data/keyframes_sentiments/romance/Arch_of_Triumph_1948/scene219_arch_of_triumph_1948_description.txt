This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a bar. The central figure is a bartender, who is standing behind the counter with his back to the camera. He is wearing a vest and holding a tray of drinks in his hands. The bar itself is well-stocked, with various bottles and glasses arranged on the shelves and the counter. A sign reading "Calvados 75" is prominently displayed in the background. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet moment in the evening at the bar.

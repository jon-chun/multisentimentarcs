This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between two men in a room. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and tie, stands behind a desk that holds a glass ashtray and a pen. He appears to be observing or listening to the other man. 

The man on the right, also wearing a suit and tie, is seated at the desk. He is holding a piece of paper with his hand resting on it, suggesting he might be reading or writing something. His posture indicates that he is engaged in conversation with the standing man.

The room they are in has a wooden panelled wall, adding a sense of warmth to the scene. A window can be seen in the background, providing context for the setting but not revealing any specific details about it.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of professionalism and seriousness due to the formal attire of the men and their serious expressions. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the photograph, emphasizing the subjects over any aesthetic embellishments.

Behind the desk, a woman is seated at a table. She's dressed in a black dress and appears to be looking at the man with an expression of concern on her face. The positioning of the characters and their expressions suggest tension between them.

The room itself has a classic design with a window that lets in light, curtains that add depth to the scene, and wallpaper that adds texture to the background. The black and white color scheme gives the image a timeless feel.

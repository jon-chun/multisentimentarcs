In terms of color, the photograph is in black and white, which adds a timeless quality to the scene. The facial expressions on the men's faces are not visible due to the angle of the shot, but their body language suggests they are engaged in an important discussion.

The camera angle gives us a sense of being part of the gathering, as if we're sitting at one of the tables and looking towards the back of the room. The lighting is dim, which adds to the formal and serious mood of the scene.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of quiet contemplation. The central figure, a woman with short hair styled in bangs, is the focal point of the composition. She is seated at a table, her posture relaxed yet thoughtful. In her hand, she holds a cigarette, its end glowing with the remnants of a recent smoke.

Her attire consists of a dark-colored blouse and a beret, adding an air of mystery to her persona. The beret casts a shadow over one eye, further enhancing her enigmatic expression. Her gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting she is lost in thought or perhaps observing something outside the frame.

The background is blurred, drawing attention back to the woman and creating a sense of depth in the image. Despite being in black and white, the photograph manages to convey a rich tapestry of emotions and narrative through its careful composition and use of light and shadow.

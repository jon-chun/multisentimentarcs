This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of intimacy between two individuals seated on a couch. The person on the left, clad in a black dress, holds a glass of wine delicately in their hand. Their companion on the right, dressed in a formal suit and tie, reciprocates the gesture by holding a cigarette. The background is shrouded in darkness, with only a curtain discernible, adding an air of mystery to the scene. The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of camaraderie and shared experience between the two individuals.

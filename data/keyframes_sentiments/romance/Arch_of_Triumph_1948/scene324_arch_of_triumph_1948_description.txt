This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Casablanca". The scene unfolds in a room adorned with curtains and a chandelier, exuding an air of sophistication. 

In the foreground, we see a group of men engrossed in a game of poker at a table draped with a green felt top. One man, distinguished by his black tuxedo and red hat, is caught mid-action as he deals cards to another player. The latter, clad in a white suit, sits attentively across from him.

The background is filled with other players, their faces etched with anticipation and focus. Their positions around the table suggest a sense of camaraderie and shared excitement.

The photograph's composition, framing, and lighting all contribute to the overall atmosphere of suspense and intrigue that is characteristic of this iconic film. The use of black and white further enhances the dramatic effect, adding depth and contrast to the scene.

In the black and white photo, a young woman is seated on a boat. She is wearing a plaid shirt and has dark hair styled in curls. Her gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting she might be lost in thought or observing something out of frame. The boat is equipped with a rope tied to its railing, indicating it's ready for use. In the background, a body of water stretches out, adding to the serene and peaceful atmosphere of the scene. The absence of color gives the image a timeless quality, focusing the viewer's attention on the woman and her surroundings.

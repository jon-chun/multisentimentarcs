This is a black and white movie still featuring the actor Alain Delon. He is standing in front of a window, wearing a tuxedo with a bow tie and a white shirt underneath. His facial expression is serious as he looks off to the side. The actress Monica Vitti is also present in the scene, dressed in a black dress and looking at Alain Delon. The overall mood of the image is dramatic and intense due to the serious expressions on their faces and the stark contrast between the light coming through the window and the dark background.

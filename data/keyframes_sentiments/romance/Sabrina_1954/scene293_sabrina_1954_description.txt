The image captures a moment from the movie "Casablanca" featuring actors Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Bogart, donned in a black suit and hat, is seated in the driver's seat of a car with his gaze directed towards the left side of the frame. Bergman, wearing a black dress, is positioned in the passenger seat and looks towards Bogart. The scene unfolds against a backdrop of a city street lined with buildings under a dark sky. The monochrome palette of the photograph adds to its dramatic effect.

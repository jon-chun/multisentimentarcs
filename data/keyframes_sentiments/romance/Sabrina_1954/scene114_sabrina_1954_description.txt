This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between four individuals. The central figure, distinguished by a hat, is being assisted with their tie by another person on either side. The individual on the left is holding the tie, while the one on the right is adjusting it. The background features a wall adorned with windows, providing context to the setting. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to this candid moment.

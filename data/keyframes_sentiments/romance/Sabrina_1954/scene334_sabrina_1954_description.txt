The image is a black and white photograph capturing the entrance of the "Arabell Builidng". The building, constructed from brick, stands tall with multiple windows punctuating its facade. A sign bearing the name "Arabell Builidng" hangs prominently above the entrance, serving as an identifier for the structure.

Perched on a flagpole in front of the building is a statue of an eagle, frozen mid-flight. The eagle's wings are spread wide, and it faces towards the right side of the image, as if ready to take off into the sky. The eagle's position on the flagpole suggests a sense of authority or power associated with the building.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the building and the eagle statue. This perspective emphasizes the height of the building and gives the eagle a larger-than-life appearance. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, highlighting the textures and details of the brickwork and the eagle statue.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of grandeur and importance associated with the "Arabell Builidng", as suggested by the imposing architecture and the majestic eagle statue. The composition of the photograph, including the low angle shot and the positioning of the eagle, further enhances this impression.

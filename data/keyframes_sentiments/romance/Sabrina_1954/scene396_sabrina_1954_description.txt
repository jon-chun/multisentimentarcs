In the black and white photograph, a woman is standing in an office setting. She is holding up a dress adorned with a floral pattern. The woman's attire consists of a black blouse paired with a white skirt. Her facial expression is one of sadness or melancholy as she gazes into the distance.

The office environment around her is minimalistic and uncluttered. A desk can be seen in the background, upon which rests a lamp. The room is illuminated by natural light filtering through a window located behind the woman. The overall composition of the image suggests a quiet moment captured within an otherwise busy workday.

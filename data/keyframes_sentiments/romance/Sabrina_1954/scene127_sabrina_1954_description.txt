The image captures a moment from the classic film "Casablanca". In the foreground, we see Humphrey Bogart, portraying the character Rick Blaine, seated in a car. He is dressed in a beige trench coat and his face carries a concerned expression. Behind him stands Ingrid Bergman, playing the character Ilsa Lund, clad in a black dress with a white headscarf. She gazes at Rick with an affectionate smile on her face. The backdrop of this scene is a brick building with a poster adorning its wall. The overall composition of the image suggests a tense and romantic atmosphere typical of the film's genre.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in time. The central focus of the image is a vintage car, specifically a **1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic**, which is parked on a street. The car's design features two round headlights and a curved hood, typical of its era.

The car is positioned in front of a building that has an archway entrance. Above the entrance, there's a sign that reads "Café de la Paix", indicating the name of the establishment. 

In addition to the car and the café, there are two individuals present in the scene. One person is standing on the sidewalk next to the car, while another person is seated inside the car. Their actions or expressions are not clearly discernible from the image.

The photograph appears to have been taken during daylight hours, as suggested by the visible lighting conditions. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene, emphasizing the vintage nature of the subjects within it.

The image is a black and white movie still featuring the iconic actress Marilyn Monroe. She is seated on a boat, her legs elegantly crossed as she holds onto a rope with both hands. Her gaze is directed off to the side, and her expression is one of concern or worry. The background reveals a body of water under a clear sky, adding to the serene yet tense atmosphere of the scene. Monroe's attire consists of a plaid dress, which adds a touch of pattern and texture to the image. Her hair is styled in loose curls, framing her face beautifully. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on Monroe and the boat, creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy.

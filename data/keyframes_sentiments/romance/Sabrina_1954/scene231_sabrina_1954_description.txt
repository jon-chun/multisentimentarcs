This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in a living room. The man on the left, dressed in a robe with a sash, stands behind the other man who is seated in a chair. The seated man holds a cane in his hand. They are engaged in what appears to be a conversation. The room they're in has a chandelier hanging from the ceiling and a painting adorning the wall. The overall composition of the image suggests a formal or significant occasion.

The room around him is furnished with a chair and a desk, both positioned to the left of the frame. The chair appears comfortable and inviting, while the desk suggests a workspace or study area. The background features a window that offers a view of a building outside, adding depth to the scene and connecting the indoor setting with the world beyond.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the film "Casablanca". The image features two main characters, Ilsa Lund and Rick Blaine, played by Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart respectively. They are positioned in a room adorned with a large window that offers a view of the ocean.

Ilsa, dressed in a white dress with black floral patterns on the back, stands near the window. Her posture is relaxed, and she appears to be lost in thought as she gazes out at the ocean. 

Rick, clad in a black suit and holding a bottle of champagne, is positioned closer to the foreground. His expression is one of concern as he looks towards Ilsa.

The room they are in has a high ceiling and a chandelier hanging from it, adding an air of grandeur to the scene. The large window allows ample light to fill the room, casting long shadows and highlighting the characters' features.

The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of tension and anticipation, as if waiting for Ilsa's response to Rick's gaze. The ocean view in the background adds depth to the scene, creating a contrast between the intimate setting and the vastness of the outside world.

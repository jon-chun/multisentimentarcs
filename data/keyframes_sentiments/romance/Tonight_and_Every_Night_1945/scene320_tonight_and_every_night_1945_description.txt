It's spreading rapidly, consuming everything in its path. The building itself is partially obscured by the flames, adding to the intensity of the scene.

In the foreground, there are several swords on display, their blades gleaming ominously against the backdrop of the burning structure. Their precise location and the way they're arranged suggest a deliberate placement, perhaps for a specific purpose or message.

The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the fire and gives a sense of scale to the scene. This perspective also allows for a clear view of the swords in the foreground.

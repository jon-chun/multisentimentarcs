In the image, we see a scene from the movie "The Right Stuff" featuring actors Glennon Hiburn and Scott Eastwood. Glennon Hiburn, portraying the character of Ted White, is dressed in a blue military uniform with gold accents. He stands in the center of the frame, his right hand raised in a salute. To his left, Scott Eastwood plays the character of Chuck Yeager. He is attired in a black suit and tie, standing slightly behind Glennon Hiburn. On Glennon Hiburn's right, we see the character of Pete Ross, played by actor Sam Elliott. He is dressed in a blue military uniform similar to Glennon Hiburn's but with white accents. The setting appears to be an indoor room with a wooden floor and a window visible in the background. The overall scene suggests a formal or ceremonial occasion within the context of the movie.

The image presents a scene set against a blue wall, where three white pieces of paper are affixed. The leftmost piece of paper is a map of the Avon Repertory Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. The middle piece of paper announces an upcoming event at the theatre: "By Permission of the Lord Chamberlain's Office Captain Poldenby Presents THE AVON REPERTORY CO. PRESENTS HAMLET W. SHAKESPEARE 7PM Prompt". The rightmost piece of paper is a sign for the Coastal Headquarters, numbered 143 and belonging to Group No. 1. The objects are stationary, with no discernible actions taking place. The relative positions of the objects suggest they have been arranged in a sequence from left to right, possibly indicating a journey or progression from one location to another.

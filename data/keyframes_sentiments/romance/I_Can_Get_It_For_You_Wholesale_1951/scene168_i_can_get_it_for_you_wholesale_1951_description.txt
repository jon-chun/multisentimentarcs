This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the film "Casablanca". The image features three main characters: Ilsa Lund, Rick Blaine, and Sam. They are seated at a table adorned with a floral centerpiece.

Ilsa Lund, dressed in a long dress, is positioned on the left side of the frame. She is holding a glass of wine delicately in her hand. Her gaze is directed towards Rick Blaine, who is seated on the right side of the table. He is attired in a suit and tie, and his attention is focused on Ilsa.

In the background, Sam, another character from the film, can be seen standing behind the table. His presence adds depth to the scene and hints at the unfolding narrative.

The photograph is taken from a high angle, providing a comprehensive view of the scene. The lighting is diffused, casting soft shadows and adding a sense of realism to the image. The composition is balanced, with each character occupying their own space on the table yet contributing to the overall harmony of the scene.

Despite being in black and white, the photograph effectively conveys the emotions and sentiments of the characters and the setting. The absence of color does not detract from the image but rather enhances its timeless quality.

The image is a black and white movie still capturing a moment between two women. The woman on the left, dressed in a white dress with a pearl necklace, has her hair styled in loose curls. She is looking to the right. On the right, another woman is seen wearing a black dress adorned with a flower corsage. Her hair is styled in an updo and she too is looking to the right. The background features a wall with a window and a plant on the windowsill. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to the scene.

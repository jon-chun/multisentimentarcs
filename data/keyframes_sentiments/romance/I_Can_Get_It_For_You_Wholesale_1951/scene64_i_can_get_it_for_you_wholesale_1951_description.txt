The image is a black and white sketch that captures a moment of interaction between two women. The woman on the left, dressed in a short dress adorned with polka dots, holds a parasol in her hand. She stands slightly behind the other woman, who is positioned to the right. This second woman is attired in a long dress, embellished with a floral pattern, and she too carries a parasol. The sketch is drawn on a piece of paper that rests on a desk, suggesting an indoor setting. The monochromatic palette and the presence of parasols hint at a vintage or historical context for this scene.

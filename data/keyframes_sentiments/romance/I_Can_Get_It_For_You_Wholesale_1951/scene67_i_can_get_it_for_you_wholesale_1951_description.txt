The image is a black and white sketch that captures the elegance of a woman in a long dress. The woman, adorned with a headpiece, stands poised with one hand gracefully resting on her hip and the other extended outwards. Her body language exudes confidence and poise. The sketch is set against a stark white background, which contrasts sharply with the black lines that define the woman's form. The monochromatic color scheme adds to the timeless quality of the image. The artist has skillfully used shading and line work to bring depth and dimension to the figure, creating a sense of three-dimensionality. The sketch is signed by the artist in the bottom right corner, adding a personal touch to this beautiful piece of art.

The image is a black and white movie still capturing a moment between two characters in a room. The man, dressed in a suit and tie, stands on the left side of the frame, his gaze directed towards the woman. She is positioned on the right side of the frame, her attention seemingly focused on him. They are both standing in front of a desk that holds a single glass ashtray. The room they're in features a window adorned with curtains and framed pictures adorning the wall behind them. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to the scene.

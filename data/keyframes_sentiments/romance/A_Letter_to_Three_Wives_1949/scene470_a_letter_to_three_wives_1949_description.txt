The image presents a handwritten note on lined paper. The note is signed by someone's hand, indicating that it was written by a person. The text of the note reads "While you were out Mr. Bishop called to say he is sorry sorry he will not be home tonight". This message conveys an apology from Mr. Bishop for not being able to return home that evening. The handwriting suggests that the note was written in a hurry, as the writing appears somewhat rushed and uneven. The lined paper has a light beige color, providing a neutral background for the handwritten text. The overall tone of the image is one of regret and apology.

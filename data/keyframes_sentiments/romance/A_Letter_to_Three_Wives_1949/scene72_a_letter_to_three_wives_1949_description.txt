In the image, there are two women seated at a table in what appears to be a living room. The woman on the left is dressed in a black dress and is holding a glass of water. She is looking towards the right with a slight smile on her face. On the right, another woman is wearing a gray dress and is also looking towards the right. A vase filled with flowers is placed on the table between them. The background consists of a bookshelf and a window dressed with curtains. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a calm and relaxed setting.

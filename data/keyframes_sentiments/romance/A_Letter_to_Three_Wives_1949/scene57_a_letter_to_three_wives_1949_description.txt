His facial expression is neutral as he looks off to the side. The room is furnished with a bed and a dresser, both of which are located behind him. A window can also be seen in the background. The color palette of the image is muted, with a focus on the man's attire contrasting against the softer tones of the room. The man's body language suggests he is at ease in his surroundings. There are no discernible texts or countable objects in the image. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-arranged space, with the man as the central figure.

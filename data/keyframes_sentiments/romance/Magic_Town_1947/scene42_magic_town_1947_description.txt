The image is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The scene takes place in a room with a desk, a chair, and a window. Two men are present in the frame.

On the left side of the photo, there's a man wearing a suit and a fedora hat. He is sitting at the desk, holding a pen in his hand, and appears to be writing or drawing something on a piece of paper. His posture suggests he is deep in thought or concentration.

On the right side of the photo, another man is standing behind the seated man. He is dressed in a suit and tie, and is looking down at the seated man. His body language indicates he might be observing or listening to what the seated man is doing.

The room they are in has a window with blinds partially drawn, suggesting it could be daytime outside. The overall setting and composition of the image create an atmosphere of seriousness and focus.

Please note that as this is a black and white photo, color information cannot be determined. Also, due to the still nature of the image, no actions or movements can be inferred.

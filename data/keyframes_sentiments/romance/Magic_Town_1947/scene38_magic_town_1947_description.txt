This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a room. The room is characterized by a brick wall and a window adorned with curtains. 

In the foreground, there are two men standing in front of a desk. The man on the left is dressed in a suit and tie, holding a book in his hand. His posture suggests he might be reading or about to read from the book. 

The man on the right is also wearing a suit and tie, but his attire is complemented by a hat. He appears to be engaged in conversation with the man on the left, as indicated by their body language.

On the desk between them, there's a telephone, suggesting that this might be an office setting. The precise positioning of the objects and characters creates a sense of depth and perspective in the image.

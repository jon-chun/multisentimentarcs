This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of three individuals seated at a table. The man on the left, clad in a suit, holds a glass of wine, his gaze directed towards the camera. At the center of the frame, a woman in a dress is seen holding a plate of food, her attention seemingly focused on it. To the right, another woman, also dressed in a suit, is captured mid-sip from her own glass of wine. The table they're gathered around is adorned with plates and glasses, suggesting a meal or gathering. In the background, a window can be seen, adding depth to the scene. The monochrome palette lends a timeless quality to this snapshot of life.

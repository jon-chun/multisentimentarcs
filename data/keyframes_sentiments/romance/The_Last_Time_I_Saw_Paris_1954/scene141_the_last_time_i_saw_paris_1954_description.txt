In the image, we see the renowned actor Alain Delon, portraying his character John Bridger from the film "The Swimming Pool". He is seated in a room adorned with floral wallpaper and a red armchair. His attire consists of a gray suit paired with a purple tie, adding a touch of elegance to his persona. The room is softly lit by a lamp situated on a table nearby. Alain Delon's expression is one of concern as he gazes into the distance, perhaps indicating an impending event or situation that has caught his attention.

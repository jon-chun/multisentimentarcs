The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of sentiment. A hand, appearing from the bottom left corner, holds a piece of paper that bears a handwritten message in cursive script. The text on the paper reads: "still be counting, still you came here tonight, I'm sorry I don't like it when you love someone". The background is blurred and indistinct, drawing focus to the hand and the message it carries. The monochrome palette adds a timeless quality to the scene, emphasizing the emotional weight of the words on the paper.

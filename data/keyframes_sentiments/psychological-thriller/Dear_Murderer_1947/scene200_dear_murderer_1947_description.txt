This is a black and white movie still from the film "Rebecca" featuring the actors Alida Valli and David O'Brien. The setting is a room with a fireplace, and the characters are positioned in front of it.

Alida Valli, portraying the character of Mrs. Danvers, is seated on a chair with her legs crossed. She is wearing a white blouse and a black skirt. Her facial expression is one of concern as she looks at David O'Brien.

David O'Brien, playing the character of George Marlow, stands behind Alida Valli. He is dressed in a dark suit and tie. His body language suggests he is in a state of alertness or attentiveness, possibly listening to Alida Valli's conversation.

The fireplace in the background adds a sense of warmth and homeliness to the scene, contrasting with the tense atmosphere suggested by the characters' expressions and body language. The black and white color scheme enhances the dramatic effect of the scene, highlighting the contrast between light and shadow and adding depth to the image.

Overall, this still captures a moment of tension and suspense in the film "Rebecca", as embodied by the expressions and actions of the characters.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". The image is taken from a low angle, focusing on the character Dorothy Gale who is descending a staircase. She is dressed in a white blouse and a blue skirt, her hand gripping the railing for support. Behind her stands the Scarecrow, his straw-stuffed form adding to the rustic charm of the scene. The backdrop features a mural depicting a cityscape, lending an air of fantasy to the setting. The monochrome palette enhances the timeless quality of this cinematic snapshot.

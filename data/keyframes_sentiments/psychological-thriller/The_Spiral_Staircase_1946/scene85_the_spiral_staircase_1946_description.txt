This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between two women in a room. The woman on the left, dressed in a long-sleeved blouse with a high collar and a bow at the back, stands with her hands clasped together in front of her. She gazes towards the right side of the frame.

On the right, another woman is seated on a chair. She is attired in a short-sleeved blouse with a round neckline and no bow at the back. Her hands are raised to her head as she looks towards the left side of the frame.

The room they occupy is furnished with a wooden dresser against one wall and a mirror hanging above it. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling, casting light around the room. The positioning of the women and their actions suggest a moment of conversation or contemplation. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in time at the Village Hotel. The main subject of the image is a horse-drawn carriage, which is positioned on the right side of the frame. The horse, a majestic creature with a dark coat, stands calmly next to the carriage, its attention seemingly focused on something off-camera.

The carriage itself is quite detailed, featuring a white canopy that contrasts sharply with its dark body. A sign reading "Village Hotel" is prominently displayed on the front of the carriage, indicating its affiliation.

In the background, you can see the entrance to the Village Hotel. The building has a porch supported by columns and a railing, adding an element of architectural interest to the scene. The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of tranquility and nostalgia, as if this moment could belong to any era in history.

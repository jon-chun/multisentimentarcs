The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of surprise. The central figure is a woman, her face lit up with an expression of shock or surprise. She's dressed in a blouse and skirt, suggesting a formal or semi-formal occasion.

She stands behind a wooden window sill, which adds depth to the composition. The window itself frames the scene, drawing attention to the woman and her reaction. 

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman. This perspective enhances her presence in the frame and emphasizes her surprised expression.

The lighting in the image is diffused, creating a soft glow that contrasts with the starkness of the black and white color scheme. The absence of color focuses attention on the textures and patterns within the scene - from the grain of the wood to the folds of the woman's blouse.

Overall, this image tells a story of surprise and emotion, captured through careful composition, lighting, and facial expression.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a scene from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". The image focuses on two characters, Glinda the Good Witch and Dorothy Gale. 

Glinda, positioned on the left side of the frame, is elegantly dressed in a long gown with a full skirt and a high collar. She stands behind a table adorned with candelabras and other props. Her posture is upright, and she gazes directly at the camera, exuding an air of authority.

On the right side of the frame, we see Dorothy Gale seated at the same table. She is attired in a simple dress and holds a basket of fruit on her lap. Her expression is one of concern as she looks down at the table.

The background features a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, adding to the grandeur of the scene. A window with curtains can also be seen, suggesting an indoor setting. The overall composition of the image creates a sense of depth and perspective.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". The image features two main characters, Dorothy Gale and Glinda the Good Witch. 

Dorothy Gale, played by Judy Garland, is seated on a wooden chair in the foreground. She is dressed in a light-colored dress with puffy sleeves, holding a small black purse in her hands. Her facial expression is one of surprise or shock, as indicated by her wide-eyed gaze.

Standing next to Dorothy is Glinda the Good Witch, portrayed by Billie Burke. Glinda is attired in a long, flowing gown and a pointed hat, typical of a witch's costume. She holds a crystal ball in her hands, a common symbol associated with witches in popular culture.

The setting of this scene is a room adorned with wallpaper featuring a floral pattern. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling, adding to the vintage aesthetic of the photograph. The monochrome color scheme enhances the timeless quality of the image.

In terms of body language and gestures, Dorothy's posture suggests she has just experienced something startling or unexpected, while Glinda's stance is confident and commanding. Their positioning relative to each other indicates a conversation or interaction between them at this moment in the story.

The photograph does not contain any text or additional objects that can be counted or located precisely. The focus is solely on the two characters and their interaction within the frame of the image.

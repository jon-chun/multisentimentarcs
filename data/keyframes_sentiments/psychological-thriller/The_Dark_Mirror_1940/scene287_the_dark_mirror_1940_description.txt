This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of intense emotion between two women in a bedroom. The woman on the left, dressed in a white dress, is seated on the bed with her legs crossed. She appears to be in a state of distress or worry, as indicated by her facial expression. On the right, another woman is standing and holding a cigarette, seemingly observing the seated woman. The room they are in has a window visible in the background, suggesting it might be daytime outside. The overall composition of the image suggests a narrative of tension and drama between the two characters.

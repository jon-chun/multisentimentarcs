This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of solitude in a bedroom. The central figure is a woman, dressed in a long-sleeved blouse and an apron, standing at a dresser with her back to the camera. She appears to be engrossed in looking at herself in the mirror.

The room is softly lit by two lamps placed on either side of the dresser, casting a warm glow that illuminates the woman's figure. The walls of the room are adorned with wallpaper featuring a floral pattern, adding a touch of elegance to the setting.

On the dresser, there are several objects including a vase and a picture frame, suggesting a personal touch to the space. The overall composition of the photograph evokes a sense of tranquility and introspection.

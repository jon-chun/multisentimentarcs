This is a black and white movie still from the film "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" featuring actors Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. The scene takes place in a room with a desk, chair, lamp, and paintings on the wall.

Elizabeth Taylor, dressed in a black dress, stands near the door with her back to the camera. Her posture suggests she is deep in thought or perhaps observing something outside the frame.

Richard Burton, wearing a suit and tie, stands at the desk. He holds a telephone receiver to his ear, indicating he is engaged in conversation. His expression is serious, suggesting the call might be of importance.

The room's lighting is dim, creating an atmosphere of intensity and focus on the characters' expressions and actions. The camera angle places Elizabeth Taylor slightly behind Richard Burton, further emphasizing his character as the central figure in this scene.

The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, highlighting the dramatic tension between the two characters. The desk, chair, lamp, and paintings provide context for the setting but do not distract from the main subjects.

Overall, this still captures a moment of deep thought and serious conversation between Elizabeth Taylor's character and Richard Burton's character in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?".

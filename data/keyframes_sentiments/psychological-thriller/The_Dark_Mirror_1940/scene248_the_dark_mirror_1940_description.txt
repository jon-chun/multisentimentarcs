This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in a car. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and hat, holds a cigarette in his hand. His gaze is directed towards the man on the right, who is also wearing a suit and hat. The man on the right looks away from the camera, seemingly lost in thought. The interior of the car forms the backdrop of this scene, with a window visible behind them. The photograph evokes a sense of nostalgia and intrigue about the story behind these two men.

This is a black and white movie still from the film "Double Indemnity". The scene takes place in a living room with floral wallpaper. A man, dressed in a suit and tie, stands behind a coffee table. He holds a gun in his hand and appears to be pointing it at a woman who sits on the couch. The woman is wearing a dress and has her hands clasped together. Another woman, also dressed in a dress, stands next to the man. The room is filled with various objects such as vases, a mirror, and a painting. The overall mood of the image is tense and suspenseful.

In the image, we see Alain Delon, portraying his character from the movie "The Pianist". He is standing in a room that has a window and a desk. Dressed in a white coat, he holds a sheet of music in his hands, his expression one of deep thought as if lost in the melody of the music. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to this poignant scene.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "I, Tonya". The image features two main characters: Raisa Rydakova (Tonya) and Anton Dolgopolov (Alexander). 

Raisa Rydakova, portraying Tonya, is seated on a chair in front of a desk. She is dressed in a black dress with the word "TESS" emblazoned across it. Her body language suggests she is deep in thought.

Standing behind the desk is Anton Dolgopolov, who plays Alexander. He is attired in a white lab coat and holds a glass of water in his hand. His posture indicates he is engaged in conversation with Tonya.

The setting appears to be an office or study, complete with a desk, chair, lamp, and bookshelf visible in the background. The monochrome color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene.

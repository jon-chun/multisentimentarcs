The image is a black and white still from the movie "Double Indemnity". The scene takes place in a room with a tiled floor. In the foreground, we see the character of Sam Spade, played by Edward G. Robinson, who is holding a gun and looking towards the right side of the frame. Behind him, there are two women dressed in suits, one standing and the other sitting on a bench. The woman standing is holding a microphone, while the one sitting has her hands folded. The overall composition creates a sense of tension and suspense typical of film noir genre.

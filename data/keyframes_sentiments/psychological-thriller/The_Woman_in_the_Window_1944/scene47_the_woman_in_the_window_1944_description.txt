The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of a woman's face. The woman, adorned with a pearl necklace, gazes off to the side, her expression pensive. She holds a cigarette in her hand, which rests on her lap. The background features a blurred image of a building, its details indistinct due to the depth of field effect applied to the photograph. The overall composition and elements within the frame suggest a narrative open to interpretation.

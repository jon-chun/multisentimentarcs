This is a black and white photograph capturing a scene on a city street at night. The image is taken from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene below. 

In the foreground, there are two benches, both empty. One bench is situated to the left of the frame, while the other is on the right. These benches appear to be made of wood and are devoid of any occupants.

The street itself is slick with rain, reflecting the glow of the streetlights and adding a sense of depth to the image. Two cars are parked along the street - one black car is located near the left bench, while another white car is parked closer to the right bench.

On the right side of the photo, there's a building with a sign that reads "The Old Fashioned". The sign is clearly visible and appears to be lit up, suggesting it might be a place of business or interest.

Overall, this image evokes a sense of quiet solitude on an otherwise bustling city street.

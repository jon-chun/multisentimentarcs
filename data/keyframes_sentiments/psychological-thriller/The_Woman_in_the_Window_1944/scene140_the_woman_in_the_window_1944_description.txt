This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of solitude in an urban setting. The main subject is a man, dressed in a hat and coat, walking away from the camera on the left side of the frame. He carries a briefcase in his hand, suggesting he might be on his way to or from work.

The man is positioned on the sidewalk, adjacent to a dark-colored car parked on the street. The car's glossy surface reflects the surrounding light, adding depth to the image. 

In the background, there are trees lining the street, providing a natural contrast to the urban environment. The sky above is clear, indicating that it might be daytime.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the man's figure and gives him an imposing presence in the frame. This perspective also allows for a detailed view of the car and its reflection.

Overall, this image evokes a sense of quiet determination and resilience, as the man continues on his journey amidst the cityscape.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The scene is bustling with activity, featuring six vehicles in total: three cars and three buses. 

The cars are scattered across the frame, their positions varying from left to right. On the left side of the photo, there's a car parked near the curb. In contrast, two more cars are situated on the right side of the photo, one closer to the center and another towards the edge.

On the right side of the photo, three buses are lined up neatly. Two of them are positioned closer to each other, while the third bus is slightly distanced from its companions.

The street itself is lined with buildings on both sides, creating a corridor-like effect. On the left side of the photo, there's a building with a chimney, adding an industrial touch to the scene. 

On the right side, another building stands out due to its large window and ornate decorations adorning it. This detail adds a sense of grandeur to the otherwise mundane cityscape.

The photograph is taken from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the street below. This perspective allows for an overview of the scene, capturing not just the vehicles but also their relative positions to each other and the surrounding buildings.

Overall, this image paints a vivid picture of a busy city street, bustling with activity and life.

The image presents a black and white movie poster for the film "Injured Girls". The poster is dominated by text in white, standing out against the dark background. The title of the film, "Injured Girls", is prominently displayed at the top, with the names of the cast members listed below it. The text is arranged in a grid-like pattern, with each name appearing on its own line. 

The poster also includes the names of the crew members who worked on the film. These names are smaller and less prominent than those of the cast members, indicating their secondary role in the production process. The overall layout of the poster suggests a focus on the key players involved in bringing the film to life.

Despite being in black and white, the poster effectively conveys the seriousness and intensity of the film's subject matter through its stark contrast between the text and background. The absence of any other elements or images on the poster further emphasizes the importance of the names listed, drawing the viewer's attention directly to them. This minimalist design approach ensures that the focus remains solely on the film and its creators.

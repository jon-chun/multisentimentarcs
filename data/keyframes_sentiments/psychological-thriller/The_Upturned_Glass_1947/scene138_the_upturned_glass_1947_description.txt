As for props and costumes, Bogart is seen wearing a black suit and tie, a white shirt, and a pair of glasses. These elements contribute to the overall character portrayal and setting of the scene.

Overall, the image is a powerful representation of a pivotal moment from "Casablanca", capturing the essence of Rick Blaine's character through careful composition, lighting, color, and the use of facial expression and body language.

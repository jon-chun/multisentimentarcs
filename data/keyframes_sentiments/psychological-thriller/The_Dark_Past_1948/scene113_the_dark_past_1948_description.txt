He holds a glass of wine in his hand, suggesting a relaxed or celebratory atmosphere. His posture is one of contemplation, with his head resting on his hand.

The setting is a room with wooden walls that add warmth to the scene. A window punctuates one wall, allowing light to filter into the room and illuminate the man's face. The table before him holds a vase filled with flowers, adding a touch of nature to the indoor setting.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of solitude in an urban setting. The main subject is a person, dressed in a long coat and hat, walking away from the camera on a sidewalk. They are carrying a suitcase, suggesting they might be traveling or returning home.

The background features a building with a large window, adding depth to the scene. A tree stands next to the building, its branches reaching out into the sky. The photograph is taken from a low angle, making the person appear larger and more imposing. This perspective also emphasizes the height of the building and the tree.

The lighting in the image is dramatic, with shadows cast on the sidewalk and the person's face. This effect is further enhanced by the black and white color scheme, which adds a timeless quality to the scene.

Overall, the film-maker has used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and visual effects to create a powerful and evocative image. The person's body language suggests a sense of purpose and determination, while the urban setting adds a layer of complexity and intrigue. The black and white color scheme enhances the mood and atmosphere, making the photograph even more striking.

To the right of the frame, another man can be seen. He's wearing a suit similar to the first man but opts for a fedora instead of a hat. His gaze is directed towards the woman, suggesting an interaction between them.

The room they're in has a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, adding a touch of grandeur to the scene. The positioning of the individuals and their expressions suggest a moment of deep thought or conversation taking place.

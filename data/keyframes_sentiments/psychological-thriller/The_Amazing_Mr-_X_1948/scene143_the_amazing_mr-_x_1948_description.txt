This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of intimacy between two women in a bedroom. The woman on the left, dressed in a white dress with ruffled sleeves, is lying on her stomach on the bed. Her head is resting on the hands of the other woman, who is wearing a white blouse and has dark hair styled into curls. The bed they are on is covered with a white blanket and there's a pillow at the head of the bed. A nightstand can be seen next to the bed, holding a lamp and a book. The room is dimly lit, adding to the serene atmosphere of the scene.

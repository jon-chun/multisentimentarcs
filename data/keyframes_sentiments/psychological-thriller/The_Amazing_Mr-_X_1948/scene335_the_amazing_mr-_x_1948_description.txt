The image is a black and white movie still featuring two men in suits. The man on the left, who is standing slightly behind the other, has his gaze directed towards the right. His suit jacket is buttoned up, and he wears a tie that hangs down to his waist. On the right, another man stands with his hands tucked into his pockets. He too is wearing a suit jacket and a tie. The background of the image reveals a room furnished with a desk and a chair. A window can be seen in the distance, through which light seems to be streaming in, illuminating the scene. The overall composition of the image suggests a formal setting, possibly an office or a meeting room.

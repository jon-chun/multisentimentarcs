The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of sentiment. A hand, appearing from the right side of the frame, holds a piece of paper with a handwritten note on it. The note, penned in cursive handwriting, expresses love for a husband named Charles Harper. The note begins with the words "Dear my husband", followed by the question "Do you love me?". It then reveals the sender's identity as Mrs. Charles Harper. The note concludes with the sentiment "Fold and conceal this sheet.".

The photograph is taken from an angle that places the hand holding the note in sharp focus, while the background remains blurred, drawing attention to the message on the paper. The monochrome color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, emphasizing the emotional content over any aesthetic concerns. The absence of other objects or individuals in the frame further isolates the sentiment expressed in the note, making it the central point of focus. The hand's position and the angle of the shot suggest a sense of intimacy and vulnerability, as if the sender is sharing this private moment with an unseen recipient.

The image presents a poignant scene captured in black and white. Dominating the frame is a handwritten note, penned on a piece of paper with a pen held by an unseen hand. The note, signed off as "Mrs. Charles J.", poses a question to an unnamed recipient: "Does my husband love me?" This query, written in cursive, hints at a deep-seated uncertainty or doubt.

The background is shrouded in darkness, drawing focus to the handwritten note and its contents. A faint shadow of the hand holding the pen can be discerned, adding a sense of depth and movement to the scene. The overall composition suggests an intimate moment of self-reflection, captured in the stark simplicity of black and white photography.

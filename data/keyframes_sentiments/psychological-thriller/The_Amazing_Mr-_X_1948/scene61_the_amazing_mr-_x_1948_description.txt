The image is a black and white movie still, capturing a moment of intense emotion. The central figure in the frame is a man, dressed in a suit and tie, exuding an air of sophistication. His facial expression is one of anger or frustration, as indicated by his furrowed brows and clenched teeth. 

The camera angle is particularly striking, taken from a low angle looking up at the man's face, which adds to the dramatic effect of the scene. The lighting in the image is dark and moody, further enhancing the sense of tension and drama.

In terms of framing and composition, the man is positioned centrally in the frame, drawing the viewer's attention directly to him and his intense expression. The background is blurred, ensuring that the focus remains on the man and his emotional state.

The color palette of the image is monochromatic due to its black and white nature, but this does not detract from the overall impact of the scene. The man's body language and gestures - particularly his clenched teeth - convey a strong sense of emotion and intensity.

In terms of props and costumes, the man's suit and tie are notable elements that contribute to his character's appearance and status in the image. The use of these items suggests that he is likely a person of importance or authority.

The depth of field is shallow, with the background out of focus, which further emphasizes the man as the main subject of this image. This technique also creates a sense of depth and three-dimensionality in the scene.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements - including facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, color, body language, props, and costumes - to create a powerful and dramatic scene that captures the viewer's attention and evokes strong emotions.

The image is a black and white still from the movie "Casablanca". The central figure in the frame is Humphrey Bogart, portraying the character of Rick Blaine. He is standing behind a bar counter, dressed in a gray suit and tie. His facial expression is one of concern or worry, as he looks off to the side. The setting appears to be a dimly lit room with a window visible in the background. On the bar counter next to Bogart, there is a glass and a candle holder. The overall composition of the image suggests a tense moment in the plot of the movie.

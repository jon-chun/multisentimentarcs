The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in suits. The man on the left, donned in a pinstriped suit with a bow tie, stands slightly behind the other man who is wearing a striped suit with a fedora hat. Both of them are looking off to the right side of the frame, their attention seemingly drawn by something outside the frame. The background features a window and curtains, adding depth to the scene. The overall composition suggests a sense of intrigue and anticipation.

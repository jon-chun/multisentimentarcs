This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in a room. The man, positioned on the right side of the frame, is donned in a suit and hat, holding a cigarette in his hand. He appears to be engaged in conversation with the woman on the left side of the photo. She is dressed in a dress and also holds a cigarette. The room they are in has a window visible in the background. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to this scene.

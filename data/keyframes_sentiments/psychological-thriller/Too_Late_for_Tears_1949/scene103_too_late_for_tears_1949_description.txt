The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actress Marilyn Monroe. She is seated on a couch, her gaze directed towards the left of the frame where another person is present. Her facial expression appears to be one of concern or worry. The background consists of a room with a door visible in the top right corner. The image does not contain any discernible text. The overall composition and elements within the frame suggest a dramatic scene from a film, possibly capturing a tense moment between Monroe's character and the person on the couch.

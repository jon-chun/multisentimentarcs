This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Sunrise" featuring the actress Nita Barrymore. The image is divided into two sections, each representing a different scene.

In the top section, we see Nita Barrymore standing in front of a wall adorned with posters. She is dressed in a fur coat and her face is lit up with a smile as she looks off to the side, creating an atmosphere of joy and anticipation.

The bottom section of the image captures another scene from the same movie. This time, Nita Barrymore is seen standing next to a man who is holding a gun. She is wearing a white dress and her facial expression has changed to one of concern or worry as she looks directly at the camera. The man's position and the presence of the gun suggest tension in this scene.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, adding depth and perspective to the image. The lighting is dramatic, with shadows cast on the wall behind them, highlighting their expressions and actions. The framing and composition of the image draw attention to Nita Barrymore's expressive face and body language, while also giving us a glimpse into the story unfolding in the movie.

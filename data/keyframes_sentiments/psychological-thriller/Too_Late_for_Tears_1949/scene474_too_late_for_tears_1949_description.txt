This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Shop Around the Corner". The image features two characters, Mária Lajtai (played by Pál Széts) and Alfred Régi (played by Ádillő Kocsis), engaged in a conversation at a table. 

Mária Lajtai is on the left side of the frame, seated with her back to the camera. She's wearing a plaid dress and has a cigarette holder in her hand. Her body language suggests she's relaxed and comfortable in the setting.

On the right side of the frame, Alfred Régi is standing upright, facing the camera. He's dressed in a suit and tie, indicating a formal or professional context to their conversation.

The table between them holds a typewriter and a bell, suggesting they might be discussing work-related matters. The typewriter and bell are significant props that add depth to the scene.

The background is blurred, drawing focus to the characters and their interaction. However, it's discernible enough to identify a store window and a street lamp, indicating an urban setting for this conversation.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of nostalgia and warmth, characteristic of the film's period setting and romantic narrative. The black and white color scheme enhances the timeless quality of the scene.

This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Power of the Dog". The main subject is actress Kirsten Dunst, who is standing in the center of the frame. She is dressed in a long black dress and has her hands placed on her hips. The setting is an old-fashioned living room with a large window and a fireplace. There are several books scattered around the floor, adding to the vintage feel of the scene. A mirror can be seen hanging on the wall next to the fireplace. The overall composition creates a sense of tension and anticipation.

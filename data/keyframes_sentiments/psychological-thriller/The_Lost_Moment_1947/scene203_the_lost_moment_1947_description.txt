This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street at night. The scene is set in front of a restaurant named "Floria". 

In the center of the frame, there's a couple walking away from the camera. The woman is dressed in a long dress, while the man is wearing a suit. Their body language suggests they are engaged in conversation as they walk.

To the left of the couple, there's another person who appears to be observing them. This individual is also dressed in a suit and seems to be walking in the opposite direction of the couple.

On the right side of the photo, there's a man wearing a hat. He is standing still and looking towards the couple, giving the impression that he might be watching or waiting for someone.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, which adds depth to the scene and emphasizes the people in the foreground. The background features buildings and street lamps, typical of an urban setting at night.

Please note that as this is a black and white photo, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the contrast between light and dark areas provides a sense of depth and atmosphere to the image.

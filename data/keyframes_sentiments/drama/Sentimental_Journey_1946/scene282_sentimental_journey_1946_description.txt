He is dressed in a long coat with a high collar, giving him an air of formality. His face is partially obscured by a pair of sunglasses, adding an element of mystery to his persona.

The room around him is furnished with a desk and a chair, suggesting a workspace or study area. A mirror hangs on the wall behind him, reflecting the room's interior and adding depth to the scene.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in a room. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and tie, stands with his hands clasped together in front of him. His gaze is directed towards the other man. On the right, another man is seen wearing a robe and holding a drink in his hand. He looks at the first man with a smile on his face. The room they are in has framed pictures adorning the wall behind them. A plant is also visible in the background. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a casual yet intimate interaction between the two men.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two women on a beach. The woman on the left, dressed in a light-colored blouse with dark buttons, has her hair styled in loose curls. She is looking at the other woman who is wearing a darker-colored blouse with light-colored stripes. This second woman has her hair styled in a braided updo and she too is looking at the first woman. The background of the image reveals the vast expanse of the ocean meeting the horizon, adding to the serene atmosphere of the scene.

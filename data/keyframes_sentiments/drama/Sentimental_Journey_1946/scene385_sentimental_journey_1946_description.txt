This is a black and white movie still from the film "Rebecca" directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The image captures a dramatic scene on a beach at night. Two women are the main subjects of this frame.

The woman on the left, dressed in a white blouse, stands with her back to the camera, adding an air of mystery. Her posture suggests she might be looking out into the ocean or perhaps watching something off-frame.

On the right, another woman is seen wearing a black hat and a white blouse similar to the first woman's. She is facing the camera, her mouth open in what appears to be a scream or shout. This could indicate surprise, fear, or excitement.

The background of the image reveals a dark sky, suggesting it's nighttime, and the vast expanse of the ocean under the moonlight. The contrast between the dark sky and the illuminated ocean adds depth to the scene.

The composition of the image places the two women in the foreground, drawing attention to their expressions and actions. The positioning of the women and their contrasting directions create a sense of tension and anticipation.

Overall, this image is a powerful representation of suspense and drama that Hitchcock's films are known for.

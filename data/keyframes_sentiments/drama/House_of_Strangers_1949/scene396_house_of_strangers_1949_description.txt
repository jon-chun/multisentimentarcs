The setting is a bedroom, characterized by a window draped with curtains and a dresser against one wall. These elements provide context to the man's location and contribute to the overall narrative of the photograph.

In terms of color, as this is a black and white image, it relies on shades of gray to convey its visual information. The absence of color focuses attention on the subject and his emotions rather than being distracted by colors.

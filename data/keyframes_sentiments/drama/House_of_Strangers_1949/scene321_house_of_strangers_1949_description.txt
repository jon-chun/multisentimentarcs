This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in what appears to be a room. The man on the left, dressed in a suit, stands with his back to the camera, his gaze directed towards the woman on the right. She is attired in a blouse and holds a small bouquet of flowers in her hand. The room they are in has a window and a door visible in the background. The overall composition suggests a formal or significant occasion.

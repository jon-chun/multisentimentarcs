This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals seated at a table. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and tie, holds a cigar in his hand, suggesting a casual yet formal setting. Across from him, the woman on the right is adorned with a hat and scarf, adding to the vintage feel of the image.

The table they're sitting at is covered with a white tablecloth, providing a stark contrast against their dark attire. On this table, there are two glasses - one empty and the other filled with an unknown liquid. A candle also sits on the table, its flame flickering in the dim light.

The background features a wooden wall, upon which hangs a painting, adding depth to the scene. The overall composition of the image suggests a quiet, intimate moment shared between the two individuals.

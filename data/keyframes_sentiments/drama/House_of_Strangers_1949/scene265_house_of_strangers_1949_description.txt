This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Casablanca". The image features two main characters, Rick Blaine (played by Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (played by Ingrid Bergman). They are seated in a booth at a café. 

Rick Blaine, positioned on the left side of the frame, is dressed in a black tuxedo with a white shirt and a black bowtie. He has a cigarette casually hanging from his mouth. On the right side of the frame, Ilsa Lund is seen wearing a black dress adorned with a floral pattern. Both characters are looking off to the side, their faces etched with expressions of concern or worry.

The background reveals other patrons seated at tables, adding to the bustling atmosphere of the café. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects and characters, along with their actions and attire, contribute to the overall narrative of the scene depicted in this photograph.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of quiet intimacy between two women. The woman on the left, clad in a black dress with a pearl necklace, sits slightly forward, her gaze directed towards the camera. Her companion, dressed in a contrasting white dress adorned with a red flower, mirrors her pose from behind. They are seated at a table draped with a white tablecloth, which holds two wine glasses and a vase filled with flowers. The backdrop is a room furnished with a chandelier and a fireplace, adding to the overall ambiance of the scene. The monochrome palette enhances the timeless quality of this moment.

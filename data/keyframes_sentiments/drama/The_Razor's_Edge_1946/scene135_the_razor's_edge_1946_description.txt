This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a cobblestone street. The scene is set in the evening, with the setting sun casting long shadows and bathing the buildings in a soft light.

In the foreground, there are three individuals engaged in conversation near a lamppost. One of them is holding a cigarette, suggesting a relaxed atmosphere. Their exact emotions or expressions are not discernible from this still image.

The background features two storefronts, one on each side of the street. The building on the left has a sign that reads "Garage", indicating it might be a place for vehicle storage or repair. On the right, there's another building with a sign that says "Mercerie", which could be a fabric store.

The cobblestone street adds a rustic charm to the scene, while the lamppost and storefronts provide context about the location and time of day. The overall composition suggests a quiet, everyday moment in an urban setting.

The image is a black and white movie still featuring two women. The woman on the left, who is the main subject of the photo, is dressed in a light-colored blouse with dark buttons. She has her hair styled in a neat bob cut. Her facial expression is one of surprise or shock, as indicated by her wide-eyed gaze.

The second woman, positioned to the right of the first, is wearing a darker-colored blouse and has her hair styled in loose curls. She appears to be looking away from the camera, suggesting she might not be the focus of this particular scene.

The background of the image reveals a dark setting with trees visible through a window. The lighting in the photo is dim, adding to the overall dramatic effect of the scene. The framing and composition of the photo suggest it was taken during a time when film photography was prevalent, possibly in the mid-20th century.

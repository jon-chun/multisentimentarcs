The use of depth of field is effective in drawing attention to the character in the foreground while still allowing for a sense of space and context in the background.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, gestures, props, costumes, depth of field, character positioning, visual effects, and post-processing to create a powerful and evocative scene from "The Great Dictator".

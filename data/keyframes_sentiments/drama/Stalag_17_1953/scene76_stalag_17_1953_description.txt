The image is a black and white photograph capturing a dramatic scene. In the foreground, a man in a military uniform stands on a muddy field. He holds a rifle in his hand, indicating a sense of authority or control. His posture suggests he is observing something or someone.

In the background, a group of people are gathered around a building with a chimney and a sign that reads "DÖRÖS". The building appears to be made of wood, adding a rustic touch to the scene. The people seem to be engaged in some sort of gathering or meeting.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the man in the foreground and gives him a larger-than-life appearance. This perspective also allows for a clear view of the building and the group of people in the background.

The muddy field suggests that the photo was taken during a rainy day, adding to the overall somber mood of the image. The black and white color scheme enhances the dramatic effect of the scene, focusing the viewer's attention on the shapes, textures, and contrasts within the image rather than being distracted by colors.

Overall, the photograph evokes a sense of tension and drama, with the man in the military uniform as the central figure. The low angle shot, combined with the black and white color scheme, creates a powerful visual impact that draws the viewer into the scene.

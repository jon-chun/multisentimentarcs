In the middle, another individual is captured mid-stride, walking towards the car. Their movement adds a dynamic element to the scene, suggesting anticipation or urgency.

On the right, the third person stands still, facing us directly. This positioning gives them prominence in the frame and allows for a more direct connection with the viewer.

The character on the left is donned in a beige cowboy hat and jacket, while the one on the right sports a white cowboy hat and jacket.

In the background, there's another group of people who appear to be part of a larger gathering. The setting is a mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky. The overall color palette of the image is dominated by shades of brown and beige, with the exception of the blue sky providing a striking contrast.

The characters' body language and gestures suggest an intense conversation taking place between them. The positioning of the characters and the horse in the foreground gives depth to the scene, while the people in the background add context to the gathering. The image does not contain any discernible text or additional objects that can be counted or located precisely.

The relative positions of the objects are such that the two characters are in the forefront, followed by the black horse, and then the group of people in the background against the backdrop of the mountains and sky.

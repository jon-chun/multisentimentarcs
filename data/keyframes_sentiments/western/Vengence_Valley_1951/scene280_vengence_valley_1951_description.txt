In the image, there are two men standing in front of a large machine. The man on the left is wearing a brown jacket and a cowboy hat, while the man on the right is dressed in a white shirt and a cowboy hat. They both appear to be engaged in conversation with each other.

The setting is outdoors, with a building visible in the background. The lighting suggests that it might be daytime. The machine they are standing in front of has a large spout on top, indicating that it could be some sort of industrial equipment.

The image does not contain any text or other discernible details. The overall scene appears to be quite casual and relaxed, with the two men seemingly at ease in their surroundings.

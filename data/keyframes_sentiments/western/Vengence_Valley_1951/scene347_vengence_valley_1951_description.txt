The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of tranquility in the countryside. The main subjects are a herd of approximately 50 cows, scattered across a hillside. They appear to be grazing peacefully, their bodies relaxed and at ease.

In the foreground, two individuals can be seen on horseback. One person is riding towards the left side of the image, while the other is heading in the opposite direction, towards the right. Their presence adds a dynamic element to the otherwise serene scene.

The background features a mountain range under a clear sky, providing a sense of depth and scale to the image. The absence of color gives the photograph a timeless quality, emphasizing the contrast between the subjects and their surroundings.

Overall, this image evokes feelings of calmness and harmony with nature, as well as a sense of adventure and exploration through the actions of the horseback riders.

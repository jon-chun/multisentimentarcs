In the image, there are two men sitting on horses in a field. The man on the left is wearing a beige cowboy hat and a light blue shirt with dark pants. He appears to be smiling at the camera. The man on the right is also wearing a beige cowboy hat but has a dark blue jacket instead of a shirt. He seems to be looking away from the camera.

The horses they are sitting on are brown, and there's a herd of cattle in the background. The field they're in appears to be vast and open, with no other people or structures visible. The overall atmosphere of the image is peaceful and serene.

The image captures a serene scene of a white steamboat named "CITY OF BOSTON" sailing on a tranquil blue river. The boat, with its black smoke billowing from the chimney, is moving towards the right side of the frame. In the foreground, there's a tree branch adding depth to the composition. The background reveals a lush landscape of trees and hills under a clear sky. The overall scene evokes a sense of calmness and nostalgia, reminiscent of leisurely river journeys in times gone by.

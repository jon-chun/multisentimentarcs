In the image, there are two men engaged in a handshake under a wooden structure. The man on the left is dressed in a green jacket and a brown hat, while the man on the right is wearing a black suit and tie. They are both standing on a wooden platform that has a railing and a barrel in the background. The setting appears to be an outdoor scene with trees visible in the distance.

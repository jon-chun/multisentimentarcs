The image captures a scene of a horse-drawn carriage on a dark street at night. The horse, in motion, is pulling the carriage towards the right side of the frame. The carriage itself is covered with a tarp, providing some cover for its contents. Two lanterns are hanging from the roof of the carriage, casting a soft glow that illuminates the immediate surroundings.

In the background, there's a building with a sign that reads "HOTEL". A person can be seen walking on the sidewalk adjacent to the street where the horse-drawn carriage is located. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a quiet and serene night in a city setting.

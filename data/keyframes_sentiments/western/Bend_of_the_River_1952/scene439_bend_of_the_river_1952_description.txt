Behind him stands Robin Wright Penn, who plays the character of Jenny Curran-Gump. She is wearing a black coat and a red scarf wrapped around her neck. Her gaze is directed towards Forrest, suggesting she is lost in thought as well.

The background of the image reveals a snowy mountain landscape under a clear blue sky. The contrast between the characters' warm clothing and the cold, wintry backdrop adds to the overall mood of the scene.

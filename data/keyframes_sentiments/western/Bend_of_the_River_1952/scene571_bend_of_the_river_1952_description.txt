The image captures a scene from the movie "Forrest Gump". In the foreground, there's a man dressed in a brown jacket and hat, standing next to a horse-drawn cart. He is holding the reins of the horse, which is black with white markings on its face and legs. The horse is pulling a wooden wagon that has a barrel on it.

In the background, another woman can be seen. She is wearing a blue coat and a headscarf, standing next to a pile of rocks. The setting appears to be outdoors, with trees visible in the distance under a clear blue sky. The image evokes a sense of nostalgia and simplicity, characteristic of the film's themes.

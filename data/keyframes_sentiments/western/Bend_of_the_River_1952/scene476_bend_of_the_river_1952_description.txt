In the image, there are two individuals sharing a moment of tranquility under a white tent. The person on the left is comfortably seated on a bed adorned with a blue blanket and a white pillow. They are dressed in a black jacket and blue jeans, their legs casually crossed as they lean back against the headboard.

On the right, another individual stands holding a lantern, casting a warm glow that illuminates the scene. They are clad in a black coat and a scarf, adding to the cozy ambiance of the setting.

The background is shrouded in darkness, with only a faint hint of a tree visible on the left side. The overall composition of the image evokes a sense of intimacy and warmth between the two individuals, set against the backdrop of a serene night under the stars.

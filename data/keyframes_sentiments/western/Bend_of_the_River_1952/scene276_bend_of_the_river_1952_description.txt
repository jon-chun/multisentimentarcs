This image captures a scene from the movie "The Grand Budapest Hotel". The main focus is on Dmitri Desgoffe-Undt, who is playing the character of Dmitri. He is standing on the back of a horse-drawn carriage, holding a large white bag in his hand. The setting is a beach with a body of water visible in the background. The sky above is blue and there are black smokestacks emitting smoke in the distance. The image has been edited to have a sepia tone, giving it an old-fashioned look.

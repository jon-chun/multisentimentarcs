The image captures a scene of rural life, featuring a man and a woman standing in front of a horse-drawn cart. The man is holding the reins of the cart, which is filled with large wooden barrels. The cart itself has two wheels and is being pulled by two brown horses.

In the background, there are other people present, but they are blurred and not the focus of the image. The setting appears to be a rocky shore, adding a rugged charm to the scene.

The color palette of the image is dominated by earth tones, with the brown of the horses and barrels contrasting against the lighter colors of the cart and the people's clothing. The overall mood of the image is one of tranquility and simplicity, evoking a sense of peaceful country living.

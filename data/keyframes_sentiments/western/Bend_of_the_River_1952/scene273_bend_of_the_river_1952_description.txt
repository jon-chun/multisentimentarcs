The image captures a scene of three individuals engaged in an activity on a wooden pier. The person on the left, dressed in a black suit and hat, is holding onto a rope attached to a horse-drawn carriage. The middle individual, also clad in a black suit but without a hat, stands next to the first person. On the right, there's another person wearing a red shirt and a black hat.

The horse-drawn carriage they're interacting with is covered by a white tarp. The pier they're standing on is made of wood and extends into a body of water. In the background, you can see trees and mountains under a clear blue sky. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects and people suggest a coordinated effort or activity involving the horse-drawn carriage.

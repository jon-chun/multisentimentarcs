The person on the left is donned in a brown cowboy hat and jacket, while the person on the right is wearing a black coat and hat. Both of them have their legs crossed, suggesting a relaxed posture. The overall scene appears to be set outdoors, possibly during a sunny day given the clear blue sky. There are no discernible texts or countable objects in the image.

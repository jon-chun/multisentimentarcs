In the image, there are two men standing in a room with a green curtain. The man on the left is wearing a blue bandana and a tan vest, while the man on the right is wearing a beige cowboy hat and a blue shirt. They both have serious expressions on their faces as they look at each other. The room they are in has a wooden floor and a white wall with a window. The overall atmosphere of the image is tense and intense.

The composition of the photo is such that the group is positioned in the center, drawing the viewer's attention to them. The background features a rocky cliff face, adding a dramatic element to the scene. A flagpole stands tall on this cliff, possibly indicating some form of landmark or gathering point.

The lighting in the image is diffused, creating a soft and even illumination that enhances the contrast between light and dark areas. This effect also adds depth to the image, making it appear three-dimensional.

The horses in the photo are calm and composed, indicating that they are well-trained and accustomed to being around people. Their positioning relative to each other and the individuals on them further emphasizes the unity of the group.

In terms of color, the black and white nature of the photo means that no colors can be discerned. However, this does not detract from the overall impact of the image, as the contrast between light and dark areas provides a rich visual experience.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, costumes, depth of field, character positioning, interaction, visual effects, and post-processing to create a compelling and evocative image.

The image is a black and white movie still from the film "Blade Runner 2049". The scene takes place in a dimly lit alleyway, with a stone wall on the right side. Three characters are present in the frame: a man in a long coat, a woman in a dress, and another man holding a gun.

The man in the long coat is standing in front of the stone wall, his back to the camera. His posture suggests he might be observing something or someone out of frame. The woman in the dress is positioned behind him, also facing away from the camera. Her presence adds an element of intrigue to the scene.

On the right side of the photo, partially obscured by the other characters, is another man. He is holding a gun and appears to be looking at something or someone off-camera. His position and action suggest he might be in a conflict or confrontation situation.

The lighting in the image is dim, creating an atmosphere of tension and mystery. The stone wall on the right side provides a stark contrast to the otherwise fluid composition of the scene.

Overall, this image captures a moment of suspense and intrigue from the film "Blade Runner 2049", with each character's position and action contributing to the overall narrative of the scene.

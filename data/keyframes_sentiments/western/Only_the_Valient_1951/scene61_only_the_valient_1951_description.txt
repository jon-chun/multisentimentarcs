The image is a black and white movie still featuring Marilyn Monroe, the iconic Hollywood actress. She is captured in her signature style, standing against a backdrop of a brick wall adorned with ivy. Her attire consists of a black dress with a white collar and a bow at the waist, adding to her classic appeal.

Marilyn Monroe's facial expression is one of concern or worry, as indicated by her furrowed brows and slightly open mouth. This expression, combined with her body language - standing upright with her hands placed on her hips - suggests she might be in the middle of a conversation or facing an unexpected situation.

The camera angle is particularly interesting as it's taken from a low angle, looking up at Monroe. This perspective not only emphasizes her height and presence but also adds a sense of drama to the scene.

In terms of lighting, the image appears to have been shot during the day, with natural light illuminating Monroe's face and upper body. The brick wall in the background provides a textured contrast to Monroe's smooth dress.

The framing and composition of the image are well-balanced, with Monroe positioned centrally against the backdrop of the brick wall and ivy. This arrangement draws the viewer's attention directly to her while also providing context for the setting.

Color is not an issue here as the image is in black and white, which adds a timeless quality to the scene.

Overall, this movie still captures a moment that feels both intimate and cinematic, showcasing Monroe's enduring allure and the skill of the film-makers who created it.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of intense emotion between two men. The man on the left, donned in a cowboy hat, is seated on a wooden chair with a high backrest. He holds a gun in his hand, pointing it towards the other man who is standing to his right. The standing man, wearing a dark shirt and sporting a mustache, looks at the seated man with a concerned expression. The background features a brick wall adorned with a window. The overall composition of the image suggests a tense confrontation between the two characters.

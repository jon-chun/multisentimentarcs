The image is a black and white sketch that depicts a castle-like structure. The castle, which is the central focus of the image, is composed of several towers and walls. It's situated on a hill, with a road leading up to it. 

Two individuals are present in the scene, one standing near the castle and the other sitting on a bench. The person standing appears to be gazing at the castle, while the one seated seems to be observing the surrounding landscape.

The sketch is signed "Fort" in the bottom right corner, indicating the artist's name or perhaps the title of the piece. The absence of color and the use of black and white suggest a focus on the architectural details of the castle and the people within the scene. The sketch does not contain any text other than the signature.

The relative positions of the objects are such that the castle is at the center, with the road leading up to it and the hill beneath it. The two individuals, one standing and one sitting, are positioned in front of the castle, adding a sense of scale and perspective to the scene. The sketch does not contain any other discernible details or elements.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of historical significance. The image features six individuals, all dressed in traditional attire, mounted on horseback. They are positioned in front of a large rock formation, which serves as the backdrop for this scene.

The horses, appearing calm and composed, are arranged in two rows. The first row consists of three horses, while the second row has two. Each rider is holding a flag, adding to the solemnity of the occasion. The flags, like the riders' attire, suggest a sense of unity and purpose among the group.

The photograph is taken from a slightly elevated angle, providing a comprehensive view of the scene. This perspective allows for an appreciation of both the individuals and their surroundings. The lighting in the image is diffused, casting soft shadows and adding depth to the composition.

Despite being a black and white image, it's rich in detail and evokes a sense of history and tradition. The absence of color does not diminish the impact of the photograph but rather enhances its timeless quality.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between two men in a courtyard. The man on the left, donned in a cowboy hat and jacket, is astride a horse, his gaze directed towards the man on the right. The man on the right, clad in a suit and tie, stands firmly on the ground, his attention seemingly focused on the man on the horse.

The backdrop of the image is a stone wall, adding an element of rustic charm to the scene. A pile of rocks can be seen in the foreground, further enhancing the outdoor setting. The photograph appears to have been taken from a low angle, giving prominence to the man on the horse and making him appear larger than life.

The lighting in the image is diffused, casting soft shadows and adding depth to the scene. The composition of the image places the two men at the center, drawing attention to their interaction. Despite being a black and white photo, the use of light and shadow creates a sense of contrast and adds visual interest to the image.

The overall sentiment evoked by the film-maker's elements in this image is one of tension and anticipation, as the man on the horse seems to be looking down at the man on the ground with an air of dominance or authority. The choice of black and white for the photograph adds a timeless quality to the scene, emphasizing the emotions over the physical details.

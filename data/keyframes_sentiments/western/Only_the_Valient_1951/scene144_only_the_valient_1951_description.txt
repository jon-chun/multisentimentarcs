Clint Eastwood, portraying the character of "The Man with No Name", stands on the left side of the frame. He is dressed in a dark-colored outfit, complete with a cowboy hat, reflecting his character's mysterious and rugged persona.

In the center of the image, Lee Van Cleef plays the role of "Blondy". He is attired in a light-colored outfit, providing a stark contrast to Eastwood's character. His cowboy hat adds to his character's distinctive look.

On the right side of the frame, Waihida Galvan appears as "The Ugly Man". He is also dressed in a dark-colored outfit and wears a cowboy hat, mirroring Eastwood's character's attire.

The characters are positioned in such a way that they form an invisible triangle, with Eastwood on one end, Van Cleef at the apex, and Galvan on the other end. This composition creates a sense of balance and tension within the frame.

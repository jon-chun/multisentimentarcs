The image is a black and white still from the movie "Apocalypse Now". The central figure in the frame is Colonel Kurtz, portrayed by Marlon Brando. He is standing in front of a horse that has its head turned to the side. Colonel Kurtz is wearing a headdress made of leaves and is holding a rifle in his hand. His facial expression is serious and he is looking off into the distance. The background consists of trees and a building, providing a natural setting for this intense scene.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing the actress Marilyn Monroe in her iconic role as Norma Jean. She is seen wearing a black headscarf adorned with a silver brooch, adding a touch of elegance to her appearance. Her gaze is directed off to the side, lending an air of contemplation or perhaps distraction to her expression. The monochrome palette of the image enhances the timeless quality of this cinematic legend.

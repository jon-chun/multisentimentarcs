He is seated on a pile of firewood in front of a stone wall. Dressed in a light-colored suit and a dark-colored hat, he exudes an air of seriousness and determination. His facial expression is serious, reflecting the intensity of his character. The camera angle is from a low angle, looking up at Eastwood, which adds to his imposing presence. The lighting is dim, casting shadows and highlighting the textures of the stone wall and firewood.

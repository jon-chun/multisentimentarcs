The character on the left is mounted on a brown horse with a white blaze on its face. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and a green jacket. The character on the right is also dressed in a black cowboy hat and jacket, but his shirt is red. Both characters have serious expressions on their faces, indicating tension or conflict. The lighting in the image is diffused, casting soft shadows and giving the scene a somewhat desolate feel. The barren landscape in the background further emphasizes this mood. The composition of the image places the two characters at the center, drawing attention to their intense expressions and contrasting outfits.

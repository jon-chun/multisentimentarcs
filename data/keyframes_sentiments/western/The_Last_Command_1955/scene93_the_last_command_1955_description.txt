He is positioned slightly off-center in the frame, adding a sense of dynamism to the composition. In the background, there's a horse, further emphasizing the western setting.

The color palette of the image is dominated by shades of gray and brown, with some black and white accents, creating a visually striking scene that complements the overall mood of the movie. The image does not contain any text or other discernible objects. The relative positions of the objects are accurately represented, with Fonda in the foreground and the horse in the background. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or describe their actions.

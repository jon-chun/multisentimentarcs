He is standing in front of a tree, donned in a striped shirt and a cowboy hat, exuding an air of ruggedness and determination. The color palette of the image is dominated by earthy tones, with the brown of the tree and Brando's attire contrasting against the greenery in the background. The camera angle is low, looking up at Brando, which adds to his imposing presence. The lighting is natural, suggesting it might be daytime, and the framing is such that Brando is the central focus of the image.

The overall composition of the image, along with Brando's facial expression and body language, conveys a sense of intensity and resolve.

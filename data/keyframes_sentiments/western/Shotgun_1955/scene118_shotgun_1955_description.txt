This image captures a scene from the movie "The Departed". The setting is a dimly lit room, adding an air of suspense and tension to the atmosphere. In the center of the frame, three men are seated around a table, engrossed in what appears to be a serious discussion.

On the left, a man with short hair is seen holding a glass of beer, his gaze fixed on something or someone off-frame. His expression is serious, perhaps indicative of the gravity of their conversation.

In the middle, another man with longer hair is also holding a glass of beer. He seems to be engaged in the discussion, his attention focused on the man at the head of the table.

In front of him, there's a table laden with several bottles and glasses, suggesting a social gathering or event. The precise positioning of these objects creates a sense of depth in the image.

Delon is dressed in a gray suit, complemented by a yellow shirt and black tie, which stands out against the darker tones of the room. His body language and gestures further enhance his character's persona in this scene. The overall composition of the image, with its careful attention to detail and use of lighting, creates a captivating visual narrative that draws the viewer into the world of John Bridger from "The Swimmer".

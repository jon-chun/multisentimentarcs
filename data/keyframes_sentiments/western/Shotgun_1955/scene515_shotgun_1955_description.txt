The image captures a scene from the movie "Forrest Gump". The central figure is Forrest Gump, portrayed by actor Tom Hanks. He is standing in front of a tree with a sign that reads "University of Alabama at Birmingham". Forrest Gump is dressed in a cowboy hat and a striped shirt adorned with a gold badge on the left side. His facial expression is one of concern as he looks off to the side, suggesting an external event or person out of frame has caught his attention. The overall color palette of the image is muted, adding to the serious tone of the scene.

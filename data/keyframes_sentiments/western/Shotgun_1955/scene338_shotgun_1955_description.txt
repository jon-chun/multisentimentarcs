The overall color palette of the image is dominated by earthy tones, with the characters' clothing and the rocky hillside adding to this effect. The composition of the image places Carson Wells on the left and Woody Pepeferd on the right, creating a balance in the scene. The relative positions of the characters and their expressions suggest a tense moment in the plot.

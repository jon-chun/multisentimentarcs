This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of historical significance. The image features a group of people on horseback, their faces set in determined expressions as they ride towards the right side of the frame. Each rider holds a flag aloft, adding to the sense of unity and purpose within the group.

The riders are positioned in front of a rocky cliff, which serves as a dramatic backdrop to this scene. The cliff's rugged texture contrasts with the smoothness of the horses and riders, creating a visually striking image.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the riders. This perspective enhances the grandeur of the scene, making the riders appear larger than life. The absence of color in the photo focuses attention on the shapes, textures, and composition of the image, rather than being distracted by colors.

Overall, this image evokes a sense of historical drama and unity, as the group of riders move together towards their destination. The use of black and white further emphasizes the seriousness and determination of the scene.

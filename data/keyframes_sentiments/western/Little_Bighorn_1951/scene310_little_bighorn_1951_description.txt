This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of historical significance. The image features six individuals, all dressed in period clothing, mounted on horseback. They are arranged in two distinct groups: three riders form the front group, while the remaining three follow behind.

The horses, captured mid-stride, add a dynamic element to the scene. Their bodies are angled towards the right side of the frame, suggesting movement in that direction. The riders, in contrast, maintain a more static posture, their gazes directed forward and slightly to the left.

The setting is a rocky hillside, providing a rugged backdrop to the scene. A few trees dot the landscape, adding depth and texture to the composition. The absence of color in the photograph enhances its timeless quality, focusing the viewer's attention on the subjects and their interaction with each other and their environment.

The depth of field is shallow, with the man and horse sharply in focus while the background appears slightly blurred. This effect further emphasizes the subjects of the photograph, making them stand out against the rocky landscape.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements - facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and costumes - to create a powerful and evocative image that tells a story of solitude, introspection, and companionship in nature.

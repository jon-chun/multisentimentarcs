This is a black and white photograph capturing a scene from the movie "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". The image features two main characters: Clint Eastwood, portraying the character of "The Man with No Name", and Lee Van Cleef, playing the character of "The Ugly".

Clint Eastwood, standing upright in the center of the frame, is dressed in a black cowboy hat, a black jacket adorned with gold epaulettes, and dark pants. He holds a gun in his right hand, pointing it towards the left side of the image.

Lee Van Cleef is seated on the ground to the right of Eastwood. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and a white shirt. His gaze is directed upwards towards Eastwood.

The background of the image reveals a rocky landscape dotted with trees under a cloudy sky. The overall composition of the photograph suggests an intense moment in the film, with Eastwood's character appearing to be in control or ready for action, while Van Cleef's character seems submissive or awaiting his fate.

The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, highlighting the contrasts and textures within the scene. The absence of color also directs the viewer's attention towards the shapes, lines, and patterns in the image, such as the silhouette of Eastwood against the sky or the rough texture of the rocky terrain.

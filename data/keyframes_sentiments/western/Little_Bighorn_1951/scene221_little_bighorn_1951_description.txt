The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of solitude in the wilderness. The central figure is a man, dressed in a cowboy hat and a denim jacket, walking away from the camera along a dirt path. His posture suggests a sense of purpose or destination. 

In the background, there's another person, also on horseback, adding an element of companionship to the scene. The horses are positioned behind the man, suggesting they might be following him.

The setting is a rural landscape, with trees and bushes dotting the horizon. This gives a sense of depth and scale to the image, emphasizing the vastness of the wilderness.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the man. This perspective adds a sense of grandeur to the scene, making the man appear larger than life.

The lighting in the image is diffused, with soft shadows cast on the ground. This gives the image a timeless quality and enhances the mood of solitude and introspection.

Overall, the film-maker has used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and composition to create a powerful and evocative scene that tells a story of adventure and exploration in the wilderness.

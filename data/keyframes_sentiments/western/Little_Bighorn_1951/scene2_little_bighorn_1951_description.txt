The image presents a black and white map of the Horn River, a tributary of the Yukon River in Alaska. The map is detailed with various place names such as "Custer's Last Stand" and "Big Horn River". The river is depicted flowing from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the map. 

In addition to the geographical elements, there are two small illustrations on the map. One illustration depicts a bird in flight over the river, while the other shows a fish swimming in the river. These illustrations add a touch of life and movement to the otherwise static map.

The map is set against a gray background, which provides a neutral backdrop that allows the details of the map to stand out. The black and white color scheme gives the image a classic and timeless feel. 

Overall, the image evokes a sense of exploration and adventure, inviting viewers to imagine themselves embarking on a journey along the Horn River.

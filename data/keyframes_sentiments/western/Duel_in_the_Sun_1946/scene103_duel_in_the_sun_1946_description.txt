He's dressed casually in a blue shirt and jeans, holding a pool cue in his right hand. The pool table, with its vibrant green surface, is scattered with several balls.

Behind Forrest, seated on a bench, is Jenny Curran, played by Robin Wright Penn. She's wearing a pink dress that stands out against the backdrop of the room. The room itself is dimly lit, adding an air of mystery to the scene. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling, casting soft light around the room.

The composition of the image places Forrest and Jenny in close proximity, suggesting their relationship. The pool table serves as a dividing line between them, symbolizing their individual paths yet connected by their shared experiences. The overall color palette is muted, with the green of the pool table and the pink of Jenny's dress providing contrast to the otherwise subdued tones.

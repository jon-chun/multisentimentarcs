The image is a black and white movie still from the 1967 film "Hotel Proctor & Gamble". The main focus of the image is a sign for the hotel. The sign, which is located on the right side of the image, reads "AMERICAN PLAN HOUSE" in large letters. The background of the image features a painting of a building with smoke coming out of its chimney. A fence can also be seen in the background. The overall mood of the image is nostalgic and evokes a sense of history due to the black and white color scheme and the old-fashioned style of the sign and painting.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the classic film "The Gold Rush". The central figures are Charlie Chaplin, portraying his character as "The Tramp", and Mack Sennett, who played the role of "The Millionaire". 

Charlie Chaplin, dressed in a suit and hat, is seated on a chair. He holds a gun in one hand and a cane in the other, embodying the quintessential tramp persona with his wide-eyed expression and comedic facial features. 

Standing next to him is Mack Sennett, attired in a white dress adorned with black polka dots. His character's flamboyance is accentuated by his extravagant costume and confident stance.

The background reveals a room filled with people, suggesting a social gathering or event. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling, adding an element of grandeur to the scene. The overall composition of the image, along with the actors' expressive performances, contributes to the humorous narrative typical of Chaplin's films.

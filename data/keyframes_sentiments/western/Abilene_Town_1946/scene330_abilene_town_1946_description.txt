His facial expression is serious, suggesting a sense of solemnity or gravity. The camera angle is low, looking up at him, which gives him an imposing presence. The lighting is diffused, casting soft shadows and adding depth to the image. The background features a window with blinds partially drawn, allowing some light to filter through.

In the image, actress Ingrid Bergman is captured in a moment of quiet intensity. She stands against a backdrop of a brick wall, her figure illuminated by a single light source positioned to her right. Her attire consists of a white blouse adorned with a delicate lace collar and a matching white skirt, adding an air of elegance to the scene.

Her facial expression is one of concern or worry, as if she's deeply engrossed in thought or anticipating something. This sentiment is further emphasized by her body language - she stands slightly off-center, leaning towards the left side of the frame, as if seeking solace or support from an unseen source.

The black and white color scheme lends a timeless quality to the image, enhancing the dramatic effect of Bergman's expression and the overall composition. The absence of any other objects or individuals in the frame puts the spotlight solely on her, making it clear that she is the focal point of this scene.

In terms of visual effects and post-processing, the image has been carefully edited to highlight Bergman's features and the textures of her clothing, while also maintaining a sense of realism. The brick wall in the background provides a stark contrast to her white attire, further emphasizing her presence in the frame.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements - from lighting and framing to color and composition - to create an image that is both visually striking and emotionally evocative.

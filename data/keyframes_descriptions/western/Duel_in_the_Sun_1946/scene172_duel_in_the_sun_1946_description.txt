On the right, we see Lee Van Cleef, who played the character of "The Bad". He is dressed in a black leather jacket and a black cowboy hat with a silver buckle, adding to his rugged appearance. His face carries a slight smirk, indicating his cunning and ruthless nature.

The image composition places Clint Eastwood on the left side of the frame, drawing attention to his serious expression, while Lee Van Cleef's position on the right balances the visual weight. The vast desert landscape in the background adds depth to the scene, emphasizing the isolation and harshness of their environment.

The image presents a scene of a person riding a horse. The rider, dressed in a black outfit and hat, is seated on the horse's back, holding onto the reins. The horse, also black, is captured mid-gallop with its front legs lifted off the ground, suggesting motion and speed. 

The background features a cloudy sky, providing a stark contrast to the dark figures of the rider and horse. In the foreground, power lines stretch across the frame, adding an element of urban setting to the scene. The overall composition creates a sense of dynamic movement within a seemingly ordinary environment.

The image is a movie poster for the film "Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens". The poster is in black and white, giving it a classic and timeless feel. At the top of the poster, there's a title that reads "Assistant Director", followed by the names of the assistant directors who worked on the film. Below this, there's another title that reads "Production Executive", again followed by the names of the production executives who contributed to the film.

The main focus of the poster is a large spaceship flying through the sky. The spaceship is white and has a pointed nose, giving it an aerodynamic look. It's positioned in the center of the poster, drawing the viewer's attention immediately.

Below the spaceship, there are two lists of names. One list reads "Sound Engineers" and the other "Property Managers". These lists are likely indicating the crew members who worked on sound engineering and property management for the film.

The background of the poster is a dark blue color with a gradient effect, which gives it depth and makes the spaceship stand out even more. The overall design of the poster suggests that this is a big budget movie with a lot of special effects and technical expertise involved in its production.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". The image features two main characters: Clint Eastwood, portraying the Man with No Name, and Lee Van Cleef, playing the role of the Ugly. They are situated in a rocky landscape dotted with trees and shrubs.

Clint Eastwood is seen kneeling on the ground, his back turned to the camera. He holds a canteen in his hand, perhaps indicating a moment of rest or preparation. His position and the canteen suggest he might be preparing for an upcoming journey or mission.

Standing next to him is Lee Van Cleef, portraying the Ugly character. He is dressed in a white shirt and dark pants, holding a rifle with a bayonet attached. The rifle and the bayonet hint at the potential conflict or danger that the characters are facing.

The composition of the image places Clint Eastwood on the left side and Lee Van Cleef on the right, creating a sense of balance and tension between the two characters. The rocky landscape serves as a fitting backdrop for this western film, adding to the overall dramatic effect of the scene.

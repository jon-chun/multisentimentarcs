This is a black and white movie still featuring three men in cowboy hats, each holding a gun. The man on the left is standing upright with his arms at his sides, while the man in the middle has his arms crossed over his chest. The man on the right is kneeling down with his arms resting on his knees. They are all dressed in dark clothing and are positioned against a backdrop of trees and bushes. The overall composition of the image suggests a tense or confrontational scene.

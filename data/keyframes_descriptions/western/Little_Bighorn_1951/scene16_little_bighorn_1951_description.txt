In the image, actor Alain Delon and actress Monica Vitti are captured in a scene from the movie "The Swimming Pool". Alain Delon, dressed in a black military uniform with gold epaulettes and a white cross on his chest, stands on the left side of the frame. He holds a lantern in his hand, casting a warm glow around him. On the right side of the frame, Monica Vitti is seen wearing a long dress adorned with blue flowers. She gazes at Alain Delon, her expression unreadable. The setting appears to be an old wooden building, adding a rustic charm to the scene. The overall composition creates a sense of tension and anticipation between the two characters.

The names are arranged in a grid format with three columns and four rows. Each name is written in all capital letters.

Starting from the top left corner, the first name listed is "Capt. Philip Wigram". As we move right across each row, we see the names of other individuals who were likely involved in the making of the film. The last name on the bottom right corner is "John Pritchard".

The background of the image features a blurred cityscape with buildings and trees, suggesting an urban setting for the film's storyline. The overall composition of the image gives a sense of the scale and complexity of the film-making process.

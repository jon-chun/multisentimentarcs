In the foreground, there's a body of water that adds depth to the image. A small boat can be seen on this body of water, further enhancing the tranquility of the scene.

The photograph appears to have been taken from a distance, as evidenced by the slight blur in the background. This gives the impression of looking through a telescope or binoculars at a distant landscape.

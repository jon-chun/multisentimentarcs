The setting is a park at night, adding to the overall somber mood of the scene. In the background, there's a bench and a tree, further emphasizing the outdoor setting. The use of black and white photography enhances the dramatic effect of the scene, highlighting the contrast between the person and their surroundings.

There are no discernible texts or countable objects in the image.

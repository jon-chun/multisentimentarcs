This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". The image features two main characters, Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, seated on horseback. Clint Eastwood, positioned on the left, is donned in a light-colored jacket and a dark-colored hat, while Lee Van Cleef, on the right, sports a dark-colored jacket and a white-colored hat. They are set against a backdrop of rocks and trees, with a third character visible in the distance. The monochrome palette adds a timeless quality to this iconic scene from Western cinema.

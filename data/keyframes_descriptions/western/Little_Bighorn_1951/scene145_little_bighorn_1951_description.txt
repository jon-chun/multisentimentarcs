The image is a black and white photograph capturing a dramatic scene. The main subjects are two individuals, one of whom is riding a horse while the other is on foot. They are positioned in front of a large rock formation that dominates the background. The sky above them is filled with clouds, adding to the overall dramatic effect of the image.

The photographer has used a low angle for the shot, looking up at the subjects and the rock formation, which gives a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The lighting in the image is diffused, softening the harsh shadows and creating a more balanced contrast between light and dark areas.

In terms of composition, the two individuals are centrally located within the frame, drawing the viewer's attention immediately. Their relative positions suggest they might be moving towards or away from the rock formation, adding a sense of motion to the otherwise still image.

The absence of color in the photograph focuses the viewer's attention on the shapes, textures, and contrasts within the scene. The black and white palette enhances the dramatic effect of the image, highlighting the details and nuances of the subjects' expressions, body language, and facial features.

Overall, the film-maker has used a combination of elements such as camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and visual effects to create a powerful and evocative scene. The use of black and white adds an additional layer of depth and emotion to the image, making it a compelling piece of visual storytelling.

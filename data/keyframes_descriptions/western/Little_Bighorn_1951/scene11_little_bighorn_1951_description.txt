This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Grifters" featuring the actress Blythe Danner. The scene takes place in a dimly lit room with a staircase leading up to another level. The main focus of the image is on Blythe Danner, who is standing in the center of the frame. She is dressed in a white dress and holds a black parasol in her hand. Her facial expression is one of surprise or shock, as indicated by her wide-eyed look.

In the background, there are two other individuals present. One person is standing on the staircase, while another is seated on a bench. Both of these figures are dressed in dark clothing, providing a stark contrast to Blythe Danner's white dress.

The room itself has a vintage feel to it, emphasized by the black and white color scheme of the photo. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows around the room and adding depth to the scene.

Overall, this image captures a dramatic moment from "The Grifters", with Blythe Danner's surprised expression at the center of the action. The use of light and shadow, as well as the positioning of the characters, creates a sense of tension and suspense that is characteristic of the film genre.

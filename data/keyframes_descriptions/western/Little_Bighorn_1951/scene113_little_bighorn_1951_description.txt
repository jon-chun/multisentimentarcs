All three are donning cowboy hats, adding a touch of ruggedness to their attire.

The background of the image reveals a wooded area, with trees scattered around, providing a natural setting for this interaction.

Framing and composition are well-balanced, with each subject occupying their own space within the frame while still contributing to the overall group dynamic. The setting and background elements provide context but do not overpower the main subjects.

The use of color in this black and white image is minimalistic, focusing on the contrast between light and dark areas to highlight specific details or emotions. Props and costumes are simple yet effective, adhering to the historical military theme of the movie.

Depth of field is shallow, drawing focus to the three men while keeping the background elements in soft focus. This technique further emphasizes the subjects and their interaction.

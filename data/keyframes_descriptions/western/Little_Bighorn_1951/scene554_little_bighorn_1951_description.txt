Inside the carriage, there are three individuals. One person appears to be holding onto the reins of the horses, while the other two seem to be passengers. The passengers are dressed in what appears to be period clothing, suggesting that this image might be from a historical era.

In addition to the carriage and its occupants, there are several people standing on the dirt road around the carriage. These individuals appear to be observing or waiting for something.

He is standing behind the other man who is wearing a red coat with gold epaulettes and has black hair. The man in the red coat is positioned slightly to the right of the frame, while the man in the beige jacket is on the left side of the image. Both men are looking towards each other, suggesting an interaction or conversation between them. The room they are in appears to be dimly lit, with the chandelier being the primary source of light. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a formal or professional setting.

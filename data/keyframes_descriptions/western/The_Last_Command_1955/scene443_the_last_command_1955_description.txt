The image captures a dramatic scene set in an old stone archway. At the center of the frame, a man is seen riding a horse through the archway. The man and the horse are silhouetted against the light filtering through the archway, creating a striking contrast. 

In the foreground, there's a large cannon with its barrel pointing towards the archway. The cannon adds an element of historical context to the scene, suggesting a time when such fortifications were common.

The background features a stone wall adorned with a red banner. The banner is inscribed with the word "Victory", which is clearly visible and appears to be the theme of this image.

The overall composition of the image, with its use of light, shadow, and silhouettes, creates a sense of depth and adds to the dramatic effect of the scene. The precise positioning of the objects and their relative positions contribute to the narrative of the image, creating a visually engaging story.

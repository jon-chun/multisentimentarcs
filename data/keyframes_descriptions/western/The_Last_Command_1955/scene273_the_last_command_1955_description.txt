He stands in the middle of the frame, donned in a blue suit and a black hat, exuding an air of authority. His gaze is directed towards the left side of the image, suggesting he is engaged in a conversation or addressing someone off-frame.

To his right, there's another character, Wilkes, played by actor Glynn Turman. He is dressed in a brown suit and tie, standing with his back to Asagble. The tension between them is palpable, hinting at the conflict that is a significant part of this film's narrative.

The background reveals a room filled with people, indicating a gathering or meeting. The presence of other characters adds depth to the scene, suggesting a larger context beyond what is immediately visible.

The color palette of the image is dominated by shades of blue and brown, which could symbolize the contrast between Asagble and Wilkes' positions in this social setting. The lighting is dim, creating an atmosphere of intensity and highlighting the characters' expressions and body language.

Overall, the image is a powerful representation of the film's themes and character dynamics, encapsulating the essence of the movie's narrative through its visual elements.

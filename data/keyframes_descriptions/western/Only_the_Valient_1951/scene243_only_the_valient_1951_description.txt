On the left, we see a character donned in a black hat and coat, standing upright with his hands confidently placed on his hips. His posture suggests a sense of authority or defiance.

On the right, another character is seen sitting down, dressed in a white shirt and a black vest. He holds a gun in his hand, pointing it towards the left side of the image. His seated position and the direction of the gun suggest he might be in a state of contemplation or preparing for an impending action.

The room they are in has dark walls which adds to the dramatic atmosphere of the scene. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling, casting light onto the characters and creating a contrast between them and their surroundings.

In the background, there's a window with curtains drawn shut, further emphasizing the indoor setting and adding depth to the image.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at Peck and Jagger. This perspective makes the characters appear larger than life, emphasizing the gravity of their situation.

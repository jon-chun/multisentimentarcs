The image is a black and white photograph capturing a scene of desolation and abandonment. The main subject of the image is an old stone building, which appears to be in a state of disrepair. The building's architecture suggests it might have been a significant structure at some point.

In front of the building, there's a wooden cross lying on the ground. The cross, weathered by time and elements, adds a sense of history and mystery to the scene.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the building. This perspective enhances the imposing presence of the structure and gives it an air of dominance over its surroundings.

The lighting in the image is dramatic, with shadows cast on the ground, creating a stark contrast between light and dark areas. The play of light and shadow adds depth to the scene and highlights the textures of the stone building and the wooden cross.

The composition of the photograph places the viewer right in front of the building, making it the focal point of the image. The positioning of the cross in front of the building further draws attention to the structure.

Despite being a black and white image, the use of light and shadow creates a rich visual texture that brings the scene to life. The absence of color focuses the viewer's attention on the shapes, forms, and textures within the image, evoking a sense of nostalgia and melancholy.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, composition, setting, color, body language, gestures, props, costumes, depth of field, character positioning, visual effects, and post-processing to create an image that tells a story of abandonment and time passing.

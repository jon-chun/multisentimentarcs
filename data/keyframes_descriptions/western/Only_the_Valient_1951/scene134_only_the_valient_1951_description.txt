The image is a black and white photograph capturing a scene of historical significance. It features a group of men, all dressed in dark clothing and hats, riding on horseback. The horses are arranged in a line, with the first one positioned on the left side of the frame and the last one on the right. 

In the background, there's a stone building with a tower that stands out prominently. A sign is also visible on the building, although the text isn't discernible from the image. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a sense of order and discipline, as the men and their horses are all aligned in a straight line.

The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, emphasizing the historical context of the scene. Despite the lack of color, the contrast between the dark clothing of the men and horses against the lighter stone building creates a visually striking composition.

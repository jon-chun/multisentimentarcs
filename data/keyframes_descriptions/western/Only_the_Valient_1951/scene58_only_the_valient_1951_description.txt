The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actress Marilyn Monroe. She is standing in front of a stone wall, with a tree branch visible behind her. Monroe is dressed in a black dress adorned with white stripes on the collar and waistband. The dress features a bow at the neck and a full skirt that falls to her knees. Her left hand is raised to her face, while her right hand rests lightly on the railing of a balcony. Her gaze is directed off to the side, and she wears a thoughtful expression on her face.

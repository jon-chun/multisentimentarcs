The image is a black and white photograph capturing a dramatic scene on a rocky cliff. The main focus of the image is a horse-drawn carriage, which is being pulled by two horses. The carriage is filled with people who appear to be in distress or fear. 

In addition to the people in the carriage, there are several individuals scattered around the cliff. Some of these individuals are also dressed in costumes and hats, suggesting that they might be part of a performance or reenactment.

The photograph is taken from a distance, making it difficult to discern specific details about the individuals and their actions. However, the overall composition of the image suggests a sense of urgency and danger, as if the people are fleeing from something or someone.

Despite being in black and white, the image is rich in detail and evokes a strong sense of narrative. The rocky cliff setting adds to the dramatic effect, creating an atmosphere of tension and uncertainty.

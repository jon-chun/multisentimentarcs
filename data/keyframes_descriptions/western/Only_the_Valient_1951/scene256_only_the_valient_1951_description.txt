The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of intense action on a beach. The scene is filled with people, some of whom are on horseback while others are on foot. They appear to be engaged in a struggle or battle, their bodies poised for movement as they charge towards the right side of the frame.

The composition of the image places the viewer at a distance from the action, creating a sense of immediacy and urgency. The camera angle is low, looking up at the people, which adds to the dramatic effect of the scene. The lighting is diffused, casting soft shadows that add depth and texture to the image.

In terms of body language and gestures, the people are tense and ready for action, their postures suggesting movement and conflict. The horses, too, appear to be part of the action, their bodies angled towards the right side of the frame.

The setting is a sandy beach, with rocks visible in the foreground, providing a stark contrast to the fluidity of the action. The background is blurred, drawing focus to the people and their actions.

There are no discernible props or costumes in the image, and the color palette is limited due to the black and white nature of the photograph. However, the varying shades of gray create a sense of depth and contrast, enhancing the dramatic effect of the scene.

Overall, the film-maker has used a combination of camera angle, lighting, composition, body language, and setting to create a powerful and dynamic image that captures a moment of intense action on a beach.

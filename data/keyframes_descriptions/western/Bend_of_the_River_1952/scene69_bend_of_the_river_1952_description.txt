The image presents a scene set in the woods, where a knife and a blue pen are resting on a bed of leaves. The knife, with its blade facing upwards, is positioned to the left of the pen. The pen, lying flat on the ground, has its tip pointing towards the right side of the image. 

The background is filled with various shades of green, indicative of the surrounding foliage. In addition to the leaves under the objects, there are a few more scattered around in the background. The overall scene gives an impression of being deep within the woods, away from any signs of human habitation.

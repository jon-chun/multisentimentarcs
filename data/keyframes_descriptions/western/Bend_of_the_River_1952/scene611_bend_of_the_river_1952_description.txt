In the image, there are two men standing in front of a group of cows. The man on the left is wearing a green jacket and holding a rope in his hand. He is smiling at the camera. The man on the right is wearing a brown jacket and also holding a rope in his hand. They are both standing on a rocky ground.

In the background, there are several cows. Some of them have horns. There's also a wagon visible in the distance. The overall scene suggests a rural setting, possibly a farm or ranch. The men seem to be engaged in some sort of activity related to the cows, perhaps herding or tending to them. The image does not contain any text.

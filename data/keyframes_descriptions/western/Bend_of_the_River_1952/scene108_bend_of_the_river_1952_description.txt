In the image, there are two men on a boat. The man in the foreground is wearing a black suit and a white shirt, and he's standing near the edge of the boat. He appears to be looking out at the water with a concerned expression on his face. 

The second man is dressed in a blue uniform and is positioned behind the first man. He seems to be observing the scene as well. The boat they're on has a red mast, which stands out against the clear blue sky in the background.

On the side of the boat, there's a sign that reads "DUNDEE". The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a sense of adventure or exploration.

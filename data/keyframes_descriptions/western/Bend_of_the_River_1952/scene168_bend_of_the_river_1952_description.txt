In the image, there are two men standing in front of a white building with a black roof. The man on the left is wearing a brown suit and a black hat, while the man on the right is dressed in a gray suit and a black hat. They are both looking off to the side, seemingly engaged in conversation or observing something out of frame.

The building behind them has a sign that reads "RIVER QUEEN". The sky above them is blue with some clouds visible in the distance. The overall scene suggests a casual, yet formal setting, possibly related to business or social events. The precise positioning of the men and their attire indicate a sense of professionalism or formality.

The colors in the image are predominantly neutral, with the white building providing a stark contrast against the blue sky. The black hats worn by both men add a touch of sophistication to their appearance.

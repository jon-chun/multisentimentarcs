The image captures a scene from the movie "Forrest Gump". In the foreground, a woman dressed in a black coat and a brown headscarf is seated on a bench. She appears to be observing the man standing next to her. The man, clad in a cowboy hat and a beige jacket, is astride a horse that's rearing up on its hind legs. The backdrop of the image is a rocky riverbank adorned with small rocks and boulders. The overall composition of the image suggests an intense moment between the two characters amidst a rugged natural setting.

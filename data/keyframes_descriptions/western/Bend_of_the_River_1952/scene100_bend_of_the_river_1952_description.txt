The setting appears to be a dusty, desert-like environment under a clear blue sky. Eastwood is dressed in a light brown jacket and a dark brown hat, embodying the ruggedness of his character. His facial expression is serious, reflecting the intensity of the scene. The composition of the image places Eastwood centrally, with the horse-drawn wagon to his left and the expansive sky to his right.

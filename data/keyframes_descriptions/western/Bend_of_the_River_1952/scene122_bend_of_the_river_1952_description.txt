The image captures a lively scene at the Clackamas Fur Exchange and Trappers Supplies store. The photo is taken from an outside perspective, looking into the store through a window that offers a distorted view of the interior.

In the heart of the store, a man in a cowboy hat stands out, holding a gun in his hand. His stance suggests he might be the shopkeeper or perhaps a customer engaged in a conversation with another man standing next to him. This second man is also dressed in a cowboy hat and holds a rope in his hand.

The store itself is filled with various items for sale. A horse can be seen in the background, adding to the rustic charm of the scene. The store's name, "Clackamas Fur Exchange and Trappers Supplies", is prominently displayed on a sign above the window, indicating the nature of the business.

Despite the distortion caused by the glass window, the image provides a glimpse into a moment of everyday life at this particular fur exchange and trapper's supplies store. The men's cowboy hats and the presence of the horse suggest that the store might be located in a rural area where such attire is common. The man with the gun adds an element of intrigue to the scene, leaving one to wonder about the story behind this image.

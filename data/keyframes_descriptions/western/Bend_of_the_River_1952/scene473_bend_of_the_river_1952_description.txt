The props and costumes used in this image are simple yet effective in setting the scene. The lantern hanging from the tent ceiling serves as a source of light and adds an element of warmth to the scene. The couple's clothing - the man's brown jacket and the woman's black coat - is realistic and fitting for the time period depicted in the movie.

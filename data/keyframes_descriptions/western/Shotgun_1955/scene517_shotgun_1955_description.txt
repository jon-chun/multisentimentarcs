In the image, there are three individuals standing in a field with trees and bushes in the background. The person on the left is donned in a cowboy hat and a striped shirt, holding a gun in their hand. The individual in the middle is wearing a white shirt and blue jeans, while the person on the right is dressed in a brown vest and black pants. They are all positioned near two horses, one of which has a saddle on its back. The overall scene appears to be set in a western environment.

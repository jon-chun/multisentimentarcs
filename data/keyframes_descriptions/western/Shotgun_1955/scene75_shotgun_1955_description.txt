The background is filled with lush green trees and bushes, providing a natural backdrop that enhances the pastoral feel of the image. The fence, made of wooden posts and wire, encloses the area where the animals reside, suggesting a sense of safety and security.

The colors in the image are predominantly green from the vegetation and brown from the wooden fence, with hints of black from the horse's coat and gray from the cow's body. These colors blend harmoniously to create a serene and peaceful atmosphere.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of calm and tranquility, capturing a moment of everyday life in nature. The precise positioning of the animals, their actions, and the surrounding environment all contribute to this feeling.

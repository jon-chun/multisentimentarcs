He is dressed in a light-colored shirt and a cowboy hat, holding a rope attached to the horse's bridle. The horse, a light brown color with a white blaze on its face, is walking towards the right side of the image.

The background of the image features a mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky. The mountains are lush green, indicating dense vegetation. The overall lighting in the image is bright and natural, suggesting it might be midday.

In terms of composition, Forrest Gump is positioned slightly to the left of center, while the horse is more towards the right. This positioning creates a sense of movement from left to right across the frame. The rope held by Forrest leads the viewer's eye towards the horse, further emphasizing its direction.

The image does not contain any text or other discernible objects. The focus is solely on Forrest Gump and his interaction with the horse in this serene natural setting.

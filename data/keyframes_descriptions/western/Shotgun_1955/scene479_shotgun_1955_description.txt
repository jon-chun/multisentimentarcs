In the image, there are two individuals situated in a desert-like setting. The person on the left is standing and holding a black object that appears to be a gun. This individual is dressed in a beige outfit complemented by a red headscarf. 

On the right, another person is seated atop a brown horse. This person is wearing a green vest over a white shirt, paired with a black hat. The horse and its rider are positioned in front of a white teepee, which stands out against the otherwise barren landscape.

The backdrop of the image features a rocky cliff under a clear blue sky, adding to the overall desert ambiance. The relative positions of the objects suggest that the standing individual is closer to the viewer than the seated person on the horse.

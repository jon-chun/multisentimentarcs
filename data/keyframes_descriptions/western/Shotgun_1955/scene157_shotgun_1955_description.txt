The man on the left is donned in a brown cowboy hat and jacket, while the man on the right sports a beige cowboy hat and jacket. Both of them are smiling, adding a warm and friendly vibe to the scene.

The props and costumes used in the scene are simple yet effective. The cowboy hats and jackets add a rustic charm to the image, while the bench provides a comfortable seating area for the characters.

The depth of field is shallow, focusing on the two men while keeping the background slightly blurred. This technique draws attention to the characters and their interaction, making them the focal point of the image.

The image captures a moment of a person riding a horse in a serene, wooded area. The rider is dressed in a green vest and a brown hat, holding the reins firmly with both hands. The horse, a beautiful brown creature, is walking on a dirt path that cuts through the lush greenery of the trees.

The camera angle is from behind the horse, giving us a clear view of the rider's back and the horse's profile. This perspective also allows us to see the surrounding environment in detail. The lighting is natural, suggesting it might be midday. The colors are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting against the brown of the horse and the rider's attire.

The body language of the rider suggests a sense of calm and control as they guide the horse along the path. The props and costumes, such as the green vest and brown hat, add to the authenticity of the scene.

The depth of field is shallow, with the horse and rider in sharp focus while the background trees are slightly blurred. This effect draws our attention to the main subjects of the image - the horse and its rider.

Overall, the film-maker has used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, costumes, depth of field, character positioning, and visual effects to create a captivating scene that tells a story.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a scene from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". The image features four individuals: three women and one man, all dressed in costumes. 

Starting from the left, the first woman is wearing a corset adorned with sequins, paired with a feathered headdress. She stands out due to her vibrant red lipstick. Next to her, the second woman is seen in a striped dress, holding a fan in her hand. The third woman, on the far right, is dressed in a white dress and holds a parasol.

The man, positioned between the two women, is wearing a suit and tie. He appears to be engaged in conversation with the women. 

They are all seated around a round table covered with a white tablecloth. On the table, there's a vase filled with flowers, adding a touch of elegance to the scene. The background features a floral wallpapered room, enhancing the vintage feel of the photograph.

The image is rich in detail and evokes a sense of nostalgia, transporting us back to the era when "The Wizard of Oz" was first released.

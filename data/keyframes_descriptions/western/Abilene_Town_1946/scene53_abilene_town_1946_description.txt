On the left side of Don Vito is Tom Hagen, played by Robert De Niro. He is also dressed in a suit and tie, but unlike Michael, he holds a book in his hand. His expression is one of concern as he looks at Don Vito.

In the background stands Fredo Corleone, played by John Cazale. He is dressed in a suit and tie like his brother Michael, but unlike him, he holds a drink in his hand. His body language suggests he is relaxed compared to the others.

The setting of this scene is a house with a porch visible in the background. The photo is taken from a low angle, making Don Vito appear larger than life and emphasizing his importance in the scene. The lighting is dramatic, casting shadows and highlighting the characters' faces and expressions.

The horses are positioned side by side, their bodies parallel to each other, suggesting a sense of camaraderie or shared purpose between the riders.

The rider on the left is donned in a hat and appears to be holding the reins firmly, indicating control over the horse. On the right, the second rider is wearing a scarf, adding a touch of elegance to their attire. Their body language suggests they are engaged in conversation with each other, perhaps discussing plans for the day or simply enjoying each other's company.

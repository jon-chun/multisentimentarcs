This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of tranquility in an urban setting. The main subject of the image is a man, who is astride a horse. He appears to be in motion, riding past a wooden fence that runs along the street. 

The man's attire consists of a hat and a jacket, suggesting perhaps a cool or windy day. His body language indicates confidence and ease as he navigates the cityscape on his steed.

In the background, there are two buildings - one with a porch and another with a balcony. These structures add depth to the image and provide context for the location. The overall composition of the photograph suggests it might be an early morning or late afternoon scene.

Please note that as this is a black and white image, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the contrast between light and dark areas provides a sense of depth and texture to the scene.

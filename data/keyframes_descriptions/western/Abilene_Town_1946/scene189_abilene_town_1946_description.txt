This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of rural life. The main subject is a man, dressed in a cowboy hat and jacket, riding a horse. He is positioned on the right side of the frame, moving towards the left. 

In the background, there's a wooden porch with two people sitting on it. One person is wearing a hat while the other has a bandana tied around their head. The porch is located on the left side of the photo.

The setting appears to be in a rural area, surrounded by trees and mountains. The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the man on the horse, which adds a sense of grandeur to his figure.

Please note that as this is a black and white image, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the contrast between light and dark areas provides depth and detail to the scene.

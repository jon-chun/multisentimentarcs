This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a bar. The main focus of the image is on two men, both dressed in suits and hats, engaged in a handshake at the center of the frame. 

The man on the left is wearing a striped shirt under his suit, while the man on the right has a badge pinned to his lapel, suggesting he might be an officer or someone of importance. Their handshake, a universal symbol of agreement or partnership, takes place over a counter that separates them.

In the background, there are other people present, but they are blurred and not the main focus of the photo, indicating that the two men in the foreground are the primary subjects of this image. The setting is further characterized by shelves stocked with bottles, likely containing various types of alcohol, which are typical elements found in a bar environment.

The lighting in the room appears to be dim, adding a sense of intimacy and warmth to the scene. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a moment of agreement or partnership between the two men, set against the backdrop of a bustling bar.

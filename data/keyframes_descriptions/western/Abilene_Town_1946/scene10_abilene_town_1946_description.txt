This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in time on a street. The image is taken from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene below. 

In the center of the frame, two individuals are riding horses. They are dressed in traditional cowboy attire, complete with hats and boots. Their bodies lean forward slightly as they guide their horses through the town.

The street they traverse is lined with buildings on both sides. These structures, possibly shops or residences, add a sense of depth to the image. 

On the right side of the photo, there's a horse-drawn carriage parked. This element suggests that the photograph was taken in an era when such modes of transportation were common.

The sky above is clear, indicating good weather at the time the photo was taken. Despite being a black and white image, it vividly conveys the atmosphere of the scene.

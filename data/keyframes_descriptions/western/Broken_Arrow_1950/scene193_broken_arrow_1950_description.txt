He is standing in front of a large pile of hay bales, which are stacked to his left. Forrest is dressed in a blue denim shirt and a brown vest, holding a black and white striped bag in his hand. His facial expression is serious as he looks off into the distance. The camera angle is low, looking up at Forrest, giving him an imposing presence.

He is lying on his back on the sandy beach, dressed in a blue shirt and jeans. His head is comfortably resting on a brown blanket that has been spread out beneath him.

To his right, there's another person who appears to be asleep. This individual is wearing a white dress adorned with fringe, adding a touch of elegance to the otherwise casual setting. The two characters are positioned in such a way that they seem to be sharing a quiet moment together.

The backdrop of this scene is a vast expanse of sand and water, enhancing the serene atmosphere of the beach. The image does not contain any discernible text or additional objects. The overall composition of the image suggests a peaceful coexistence between the characters and their surroundings.

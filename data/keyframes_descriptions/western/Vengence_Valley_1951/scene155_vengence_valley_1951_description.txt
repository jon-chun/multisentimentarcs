On the left side of the frame is Grace Kelly. She's wearing a long dress with a full skirt and a high collar, typical of the fashion of that era. Her posture is relaxed yet alert, indicating she's aware of her surroundings.

Behind these two characters stands Thomas Mitchell. He's dressed in a white shirt and suspenders, holding a rifle. His position behind Gary Cooper suggests he's there to provide backup if needed.

This image captures a scene from the movie "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". The main focus is on three men, each riding a horse. 

1. On the left, there's a man wearing a green jacket and a cowboy hat. He's sitting atop a black horse.
2. In the middle, another man is seen in a white shirt and a cowboy hat. He's riding a brown horse.
3. On the right, there's a third man dressed in a blue shirt and a cowboy hat. He's mounted on a gray horse.

The men are positioned in such a way that they form an arc, with the man in the green jacket on the left, the one in the white shirt in the middle, and the man in the blue shirt on the right. 

In the background, there's a herd of cattle, suggesting that this scene might be taking place in a ranch or a farm. The image is in black and white, which adds to the dramatic effect of the scene.

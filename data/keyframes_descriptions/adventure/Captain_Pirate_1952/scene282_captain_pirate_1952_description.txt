In the image, actor Michael Stuhlbarg is captured in a scene from the movie "The Good Girl". He is seated on a wooden chair with a curved backrest and armrests. Dressed in a light blue button-down shirt, he gazes off to the side with a thoughtful expression. The room around him is dimly lit, creating an atmosphere of quiet contemplation. A window can be seen in the background, its curtains drawn closed. On the right side of the frame, actor Zooey Deschanel stands, holding a lamp that casts a soft glow on Stuhlbarg's face. The overall scene suggests a moment of introspection or deep thought for Stuhlbarg's character.

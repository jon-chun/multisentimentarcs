This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Big Lebowski". The scene takes place in a dimly lit room with a wooden floor. In the foreground, there are three main characters: The Dude (played by Jeff Bridges), Maude (played by Julianne Moore), and Donny (played by Ben Stiller).

The Dude is standing on the left side of the frame, wearing a white shirt and a bandana on his head. He is looking at Maude with a concerned expression.

Maude is standing in the middle of the frame, dressed in a long dress adorned with flowers. She is looking at The Dude with a neutral expression.

Donny is standing on the right side of the frame, wearing a black suit and tie. He is looking at The Dude with a surprised expression.

The background features a bookshelf filled with various books and a lamp placed on top. The overall composition of the image suggests a tense moment between the characters in this scene.

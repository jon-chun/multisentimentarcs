The image is a movie poster for the film "The End". The background of the poster is black and white, creating a stark contrast with the title of the film which is written in large white letters. The title is positioned at the top center of the poster, drawing immediate attention.

In the bottom right corner of the poster, there's an image of a dinosaur skeleton, rendered in black and white. The dinosaur appears to be walking towards the viewer, adding a sense of movement and dynamism to the otherwise static poster.

The text "a Robert L. Lippert Presentation" is written in smaller white letters at the bottom center of the poster, indicating that this film was presented by Robert L. Lippert. The overall layout of the poster suggests a serious and dramatic tone for the film, fitting for a dinosaur-themed movie.

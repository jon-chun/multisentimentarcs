His facial expression is one of anger or frustration, as indicated by his furrowed brows and the tightness around his mouth.

The camera angle is from a low angle, looking up at the man, which adds to the sense of power and authority he exudes despite his apparent distress. The lighting in the image is dramatic, with light coming from the left side of the frame, casting shadows on the right side and highlighting the man's features.

The setting appears to be an indoor room filled with people, suggesting a gathering or event of some sort. However, the focus remains firmly on the man in the military uniform, his presence dominating the scene.

In terms of color, as this is a black and white image, it's difficult to determine specific hues without additional information. However, the contrast between light and dark areas provides depth and texture to the image.

The man's body language and gestures further emphasize his anger or frustration. His posture is rigid, and he seems to be bracing himself for an impending confrontation or reaction.

As for props and costumes, the man's military uniform is the most prominent element in this regard. The peaked cap and sash are typical elements of such attire, suggesting a formal or ceremonial occasion.

In terms of depth of field, the image appears to have been captured with a shallow focus, with the man sharply in focus while the background is blurred, drawing attention to him as the main subject.

The character positioning and interaction suggest that the man is at the center of this scene, with other people and elements serving as supporting details rather than main characters. The visual effects and post-processing techniques used in this image are not specified, but they likely contribute to the dramatic effect of the photograph.

Overall, this image captures a powerful moment of emotion and tension, with careful attention to detail in terms of lighting, composition, and character portrayal.

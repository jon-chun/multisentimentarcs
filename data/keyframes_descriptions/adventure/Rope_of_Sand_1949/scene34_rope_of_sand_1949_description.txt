The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the man, which adds to his imposing presence and dominance in the frame. The background features a wooden building, providing a rustic charm to the overall composition. A crane can be seen in the distance, hinting at ongoing construction or development in the area.

Despite being a black and white image, the contrast between light and dark areas creates depth and texture, enhancing the visual appeal of the photograph.

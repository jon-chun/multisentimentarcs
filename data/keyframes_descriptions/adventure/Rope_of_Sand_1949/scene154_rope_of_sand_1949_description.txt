This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of intense concentration at a poker table. The image is taken from an overhead perspective, providing a bird's eye view of the scene.

In the foreground, two hands are seen holding stacks of poker chips, their fingers deftly sorting through them. The chips are predominantly red and white in color, adding to the monochrome aesthetic of the photograph.

The background features another person sitting at the table, engrossed in the game. A bowl filled with cigarettes is placed on the table, hinting at the high-stakes nature of the game being played.

The image evokes a sense of suspense and anticipation, as if waiting for the next move to be made. The absence of color and the focus on the poker chips suggest that the stakes are high and the tension is palpable. The overhead perspective adds an element of drama and intensity to the scene. Overall, this photograph beautifully captures the essence of a high-stakes poker game.

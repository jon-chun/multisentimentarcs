On the right side of the image, there's a wooden bridge that spans across the lake. The bridge, made of planks, blends harmoniously with the surrounding nature. A railing runs along one side of the bridge, providing safety for those who traverse it.

In the foreground, two individuals are present. One is seated on a rock, while the other stands nearby. Their presence adds a touch of life to the otherwise still scene.

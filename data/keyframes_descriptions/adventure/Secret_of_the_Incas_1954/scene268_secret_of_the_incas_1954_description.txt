In the image, there are two men in a bar setting. The man on the left is seated at a table with a drink in front of him. He is wearing a brown leather jacket and has his head tilted to the side as he looks up at the other man. The man on the right stands behind the seated man, holding a glass of beer in his hand. He is dressed in a black suit and tie. The background reveals a bar with various bottles and glasses on shelves, along with a clock mounted on the wall. The overall atmosphere suggests a casual social gathering or conversation taking place between the two men.

Behind her, actor Armie Hammer can be seen seated at a desk, his attention focused on Brie's character. The setting appears to be an office or study, adorned with curtains and a bookshelf in the background. The color palette of the image is muted, with brown tones dominating the scene, reflecting the serious and suspenseful nature of the film.

In the image, there are two men standing in front of a stone wall. The man on the left is wearing a brown leather jacket and has a badge on his lapel. He is looking to the right with a serious expression. On the right, the other man is dressed in a beige trench coat and a cowboy hat. He is looking to the left with a neutral expression. The stone wall behind them is made of large stones and has moss growing on it. There are no texts or other objects in the image. The relative positions of the men suggest they might be engaged in a conversation or observing something off-frame. The overall atmosphere of the image appears to be serious and somewhat tense.

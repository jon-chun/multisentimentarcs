This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of tranquility. The main subject is a horse, adorned with a white ribbon tied around its neck and another white bow resting on its back. The horse stands in front of a building, which features a window and a door.

To the right of the horse, there's a person dressed in a light-colored outfit, complete with a hat. They are facing away from the camera, adding an air of mystery to their identity. Their body language suggests they might be observing or interacting with the horse.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the size and presence of both the horse and the person. The composition of the image places the horse in the center, drawing attention to it immediately. Despite being a black and white image, the contrast between light and dark areas creates depth and texture, enhancing the overall visual appeal.

Please note that as this is a black and white image, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the use of light and shadow provides an effective way to convey depth and dimension in the scene.

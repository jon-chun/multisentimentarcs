This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in what appears to be an indoor setting. The person on the left, clad in a dark-colored vest with buttons running down the front, stands slightly behind the person on the right. The individual on the right is adorned in a long coat embellished with large buttons, and a hat rests atop their head. Their gazes are directed towards each other, suggesting an intimate or significant interaction between them. The background features an arched window, adding depth to the scene. The monochrome palette of the image lends it a timeless quality.

In the background, there are two smaller trees, one on each side of the larger tree. They add depth to the image and create a balanced composition. The sky above is clear, suggesting a calm and peaceful day.

The photograph appears to be taken from a low angle, looking up at the trees. This perspective enhances the grandeur of the tall tree and gives the viewer a sense of being in its shadow.

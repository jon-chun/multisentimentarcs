She is dressed in a long coat, adding an air of mystery to her character. Her gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting deep thought or contemplation. The camera angle is low, looking up at her, which adds to her enigmatic presence. The lighting is dramatic, coming from the top left corner and casting shadows on the right side of her face, highlighting her features and creating a sense of depth and dimension in the image. The composition of the photograph places the woman in the center, drawing the viewer's attention directly to her. The stone walls provide a textured backdrop that contrasts with the smooth fabric of her coat. Despite being a black and white image, the play of light and shadow adds depth and richness to the scene. Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and costumes to create an evocative and powerful image.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of historical significance. It features an old television set, which is the central object in the frame. The television screen displays a scene from what appears to be a newsreel or documentary, showing people gathered around a large building. The text "After Hours Are Off" is visible on the television screen.

The television set itself is situated on a wooden stand with two shelves. On the lower shelf of the stand, there's a small clock displaying the time as 9:30. 

The background of the image reveals a wall adorned with a sign that reads "No Smoking". The overall composition of the image suggests it might be from an era when television was a relatively new medium for broadcasting news and documentaries. The black and white color scheme adds to the vintage feel of the photograph.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between a man and a horse in a room. The man, dressed in a suit and hat, stands to the left of the frame, holding the reins of the horse. The horse, draped in a blanket, is positioned on the right side of the image. It appears to be drinking from a trough placed on the floor. The background features a white wall adorned with a window and a sink. The overall composition creates an atmosphere of tranquility and harmony between man and animal.

His facial expression is serious, indicating that he is deeply engrossed in thought or perhaps engaged in a conversation of significance. The camera angle is from the side, providing a profile view of his face and upper body. This framing choice emphasizes his thoughtful demeanor and adds depth to the image.

The lighting in the photograph is diffused, casting soft shadows and adding a sense of calmness to the scene.

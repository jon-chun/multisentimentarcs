In this black and white photo, two men are engaged in a conversation. The man on the left is holding a bundle of sticks, while the man on the right is holding a cigarette. They are standing in front of a wooden wall that has a window. The man on the left is wearing a suit and tie, while the man on the right is dressed in a jacket and tie. Their facial expressions suggest they are deeply engrossed in their conversation. The camera angle is slightly elevated, giving us a clear view of their faces and upper bodies. The lighting appears to be natural, coming from the window behind them. The framing and composition of the photo place the two men as the central focus, with the wooden wall serving as a simple yet effective backdrop.

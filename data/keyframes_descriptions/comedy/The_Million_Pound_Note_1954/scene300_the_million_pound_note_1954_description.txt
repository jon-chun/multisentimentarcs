Standing behind Lucy are several other characters from the film. These include Lucy's cousin Lucy Honeychurch, played by Maggie Smith; Lucy's uncle Mr. Beebe, portrayed by John Standing; and Lucy's aunt Aunt Lucy Honeychurch, acted by Prunella Scales.

The colors in the image are vibrant, with the blue of Lucy's dress standing out against the greenery of the park.

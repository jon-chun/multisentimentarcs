Agatha, dressed in a vibrant purple dress and hat, holds a fan in her hand. Her outfit stands out against the more muted colors of the scene. Dmitri is wearing a formal gray suit complemented by a red flower on his lapel. His attire suggests he might be an important figure or guest at the hotel.

Monsieur, clad in a blue suit and hat, holds a cane. His posture and expression are not clearly visible in the image.

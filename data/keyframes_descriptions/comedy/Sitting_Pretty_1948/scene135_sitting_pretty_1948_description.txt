On the left, a woman with short hair is seen holding a towel in her hands. Her expression is one of concern or worry. In the middle, another woman with short hair is dressed in a suit and tie, exuding an air of confidence or authority. To the right, a third woman with long hair is wearing a dress adorned with a flower on the lapel, suggesting a sense of elegance or sophistication.

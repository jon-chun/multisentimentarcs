This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between three women in formal attire. The woman on the left, clad in a light-colored dress, extends her hand towards the woman in the center who is elegantly dressed in black. On the right, another woman in a dark-colored dress observes the exchange. They are positioned against a backdrop featuring framed pictures and text that reads "Dr. William H. Sebree". The image evokes a sense of formality and social interaction, with the women's attire and gestures suggesting a moment of greeting or conversation.

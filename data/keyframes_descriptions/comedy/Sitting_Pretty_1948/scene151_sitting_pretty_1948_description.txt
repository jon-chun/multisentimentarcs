In this black and white photograph, we see a scene from the movie "Pulp Fiction". The central focus is on two characters, John Travolta as Vincent Vega and Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace. They are seated at a table in a diner booth, engaged in conversation.

John Travolta, portraying Vincent Vega, is positioned on the left side of the frame. He is dressed in a gray suit with a white shirt and tie, his hands clasped together in front of him. His expression is one of concern as he looks at Mia Wallace.

On the right side of the frame is Uma Thurman, playing Mia Wallace. She is wearing a black dress adorned with a white collar and apron. Her gaze is directed towards John Travolta, her face reflecting an unreadable emotion.

The table between them holds a coffee cup and a glass of water, suggesting a casual setting. The background features a window that offers a view of the outside world - a street lined with buildings and trees.

The overall composition of the image places emphasis on the characters and their interaction, while the background elements provide context to the scene. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the photograph.

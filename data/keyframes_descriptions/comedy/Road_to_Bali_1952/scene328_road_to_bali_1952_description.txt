The image is a black and white movie still from the film "A Passage to Shambhala". The scene takes place in a river, where two men are the main subjects. One man is standing on the bank of the river, holding a spear in his hand. He appears to be observing or watching something off-frame. The other man is partially submerged in the water, with only his head and upper body visible above the surface. His posture suggests he might be swimming or engaged in some form of aquatic activity.

In the background, there's another person who seems to be a woman. She is dressed in traditional Indian attire, which includes a sari and a headscarf. Her presence adds an element of cultural context to the scene.

The composition of the image places the two men in the foreground, drawing attention to them first before leading the viewer's eye towards the woman in the background. The river serves as a natural divider in the frame, separating the subjects and creating a sense of depth.

The black and white color scheme gives the image a timeless feel, emphasizing the contrast between light and dark areas rather than relying on color for visual cues. This choice might be intended to create a specific mood or atmosphere, perhaps evoking a sense of nostalgia or a connection to history.

Overall, the film-maker has used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, composition, setting, color, body language and gestures, props and costumes, depth of field, character positioning and interaction, visual effects and post-processing to create a compelling and visually engaging scene.

The image captures a moment from the movie "A Passage to Shambhala" featuring actors Richard Kiehl and Michael Stuhlbarg. The scene takes place in a room with a large window that allows natural light to flood in, illuminating the two characters. 

Richard Kiehl, dressed in a blue and white striped shirt paired with a purple headscarf, is seated on the left side of the frame. His gaze is directed towards Michael Stuhlbarg, who is positioned on his right. Michael Stuhlbarg is attired in a blue and white striped robe, complemented by a white turban. 

The characters are engaged in what appears to be an intense conversation, their expressions reflecting deep thought and seriousness. The room they're in is minimally decorated, with the large window being the most prominent feature. The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of tranquility and introspection.

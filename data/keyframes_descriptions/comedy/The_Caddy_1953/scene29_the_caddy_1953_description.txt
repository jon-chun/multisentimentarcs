The men are standing on a stage with a curtain serving as the backdrop, adding to the theatrical ambiance of the scene. The stage appears to be well-lit, highlighting the performers and their instruments.

In the background, there's another man who seems to be part of the performance. He is holding a guitar, possibly providing additional musical accompaniment to the duet.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the performers. This perspective gives a sense of grandeur to the performers and emphasizes their presence on stage.

The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, focusing the viewer's attention on the performers and their expressions rather than being distracted by colors.

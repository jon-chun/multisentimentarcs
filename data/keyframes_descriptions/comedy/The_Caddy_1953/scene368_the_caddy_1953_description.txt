In this black and white photograph, we see a scene from the movie "The Godfather". The actor Al Pacino, portraying the character Michael Corleone, is on the left side of the frame. He is dressed in a white shirt, a striped vest, and holds a checkered cloth in his hands. On the right side of the frame, we see Marlon Brando, who played the character Don Vito Corleone. He is wearing a black suit and holding a gun. The setting appears to be a room with a window and a coat rack visible in the background. The overall composition of the image suggests a tense moment between the two characters.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men. The man on the left, dressed in a tuxedo with a bowtie, stands slightly behind the man on the right, who is wearing a suit with a bowtie. They are positioned in front of a building, which has a window visible in the background. The man on the right appears to be looking at the man on the left, and both men have slight smiles on their faces. The overall composition of the image suggests a formal or semi-formal setting.

The golfer is surrounded by a group of spectators, all attentively watching the ongoing action. Their body language reflects anticipation and excitement, adding to the overall tension of the scene.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the golfer. This perspective emphasizes the golfer's stature and the importance of his action. The camera angle also allows for a clear view of the spectators in the background, further enhancing the depth of the image.

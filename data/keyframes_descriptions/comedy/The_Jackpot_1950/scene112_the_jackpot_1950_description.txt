Rick Blaine, portrayed by Humphrey Bogart, is positioned on the left side of the frame. He is dressed in a gray suit and a black hat, holding a book in his hand. His facial expression is neutral, suggesting he might be deep in thought or simply observing the scene.

In the center of the image stands Ilsa Rydberg, played by Ingrid Bergman. She is wearing a white dress adorned with blue polka dots. Her body language and facial expression suggest she is engaged in conversation with Rick.

On the right side of the frame is Sam, played by Dooley Wilson. He is dressed in a black suit and tie, holding a drink in his hand. His posture and gaze are directed towards Ilsa, indicating he might be listening to their conversation or waiting for his turn to speak.

The setting appears to be a room with a striped curtain in the background, adding depth to the scene. The overall composition of the image suggests a tense and dramatic moment from the movie, with each character absorbed in their own thoughts and emotions.

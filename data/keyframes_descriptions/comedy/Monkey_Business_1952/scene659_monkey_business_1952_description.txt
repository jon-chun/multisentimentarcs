The image presents a black and white scene featuring two glass jars filled with water. Each jar houses a small fish, their bodies visible through the transparent glass. The jar on the left is slightly closer to the viewer, creating a sense of depth in the composition. The background is blurred, drawing focus to the jars and their aquatic inhabitants. The absence of color and additional elements lends an air of simplicity and tranquility to the image.

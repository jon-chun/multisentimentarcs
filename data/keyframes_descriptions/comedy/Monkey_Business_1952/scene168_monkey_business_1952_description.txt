There is no color in the image as it is black and white, which adds a timeless quality to the scene. Body language and gestures are subtle but convey a sense of seriousness and dedication to his work.

Props and costumes include the lab coat worn by the man, the various pieces of scientific equipment on the desk, and the glassware scattered around the desk.

The depth of field is shallow, with the focus primarily on the man and the items on the desk. The character positioning and interaction are such that the man appears to be alone in his work, surrounded by the silent symphony of science.

Visual effects and post-processing techniques have been used to enhance the overall mood and atmosphere of the image, creating a sense of depth and realism. The image is a powerful representation of scientific dedication and focus.

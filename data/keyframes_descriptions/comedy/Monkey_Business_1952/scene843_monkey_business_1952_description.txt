This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The scene features two men, both dressed in suits and hats, walking away from the camera. 

The man on the left is clad in a dark suit and hat, while the man on the right sports a light-colored suit and hat. They are both moving towards the right side of the frame, their backs to us.

In the background, there's a building with a porch and a car parked nearby. The street they're walking on extends into the distance, lined with trees that add depth to the scene.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the stature of the men and gives us a unique perspective of their journey. The lighting in the image is diffused, softening the overall mood and adding a sense of tranquility to the scene.

Please note that as this is a black and white photo, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the contrast between light and dark areas provides depth and detail to the image.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a tender moment between a mother and her child. The mother, dressed in a striped shirt, is seated on a couch with the child nestled comfortably on her lap. The child, wearing a onesie, appears to be in a state of curiosity or wonder as they gaze off to the side. The room they are in has a window visible in the background, suggesting it might be daytime outside. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to this intimate scene.

The setting is a multi-lane highway, with multiple lanes visible in both directions. There are several other cars present on the road, but they are blurred due to their distance and speed, indicating that the focus of this image is the vintage car.

In the background, there's a billboard displaying an advertisement for "Pabst Blue Ribbon". The billboard stands out against the sky, adding a touch of urban life to the scene. 

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the car, which gives a sense of motion and speed to the image. This perspective also emphasizes the vintage car as the focal point.

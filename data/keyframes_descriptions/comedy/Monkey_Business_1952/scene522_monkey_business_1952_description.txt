Dorothy Gale, positioned on the left side of the frame, is wearing a blue dress and has her hair styled in curls. She appears to be engaged in conversation with the Scarecrow.

The Scarecrow, located on the right side of the image, is dressed in a straw hat and suit. He too seems to be participating in the dialogue with Dorothy.

The car they are seated in is black, contrasting with their colorful attire. The road they are traveling on stretches out into the distance, flanked by trees and buildings on either side.

In the background, there's another car approaching from the opposite direction. This car is white and features a distinctive red stripe on its hood.

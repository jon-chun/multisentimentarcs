In the black and white photo, a man is standing in front of a bar counter. He's wearing a lab coat and glasses, suggesting he might be a scientist or a researcher. The bar counter behind him is filled with various bottles and glasses, indicating that this could be a laboratory setting. 

The man appears to be examining a test tube held in his right hand, which suggests that he might be conducting an experiment or analyzing some data. His left hand is resting on the counter, possibly steadying himself during his work.

In the background, there's a sink and a faucet, further supporting the idea that this is a laboratory setting. The overall scene gives off a sense of scientific exploration and discovery.

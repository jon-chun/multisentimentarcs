The man on the left is wearing a light-colored suit, while the man on the right is wearing a dark-colored suit. They are walking towards a car that is parked on the side of the street. The car has a shiny hood and chrome accents, suggesting it might be a classic or well-maintained vehicle.

In the background, there's a building with a sign that reads "BIRCO". This could possibly indicate a business or store in the vicinity. There are also other cars parked on the street, indicating that this is a busy area.

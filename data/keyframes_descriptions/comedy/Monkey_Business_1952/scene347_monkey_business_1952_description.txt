This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men on a street. The man on the left, dressed in a light-colored suit and tie, stands slightly ahead of the other man who is wearing a dark-colored suit and tie. They are both facing away from the camera, their attention seemingly drawn to something off-frame. 

The background reveals a bustling cityscape with cars parked along the street. A sign for "KROQ" is visible, suggesting the location might be near a radio station or broadcasting facility. The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of intrigue and curiosity about what has caught the attention of these two men.

The color palette of the image is dominated by shades of white and black, reflecting the man's attire and the house's exterior, while the green leaves of the tree provide a pop of color.

The camera angle is from a low angle, looking up at the man as he approaches the house. This perspective gives the viewer a sense of the man's stature and importance. The lighting in the image is natural, suggesting it was taken during the day under clear skies.

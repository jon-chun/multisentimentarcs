Behind him, Robert De Niro, playing the character Don Vito Corleone, is seen wearing a white shirt and a black jacket. He stands calmly with his arms crossed. The setting is a room adorned with a chandelier hanging from the ceiling and a mirror reflecting the scene. The overall color scheme of the image is dark, adding to the intensity of the characters' expressions and actions.

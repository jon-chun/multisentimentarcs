The image captures a poignant scene from the movie "Forrest Gump". The central figure is Forrest Gump himself, portrayed by Tom Hanks. He is seen lying in bed, his body covered with a white blanket that contrasts sharply with the dark room around him. His face wears a look of sadness and longing, adding an emotional depth to the scene.

The camera angle is low, looking up at Forrest, which gives him an imposing presence despite his physical vulnerability. The lighting is dim, further emphasizing the somber mood. Framing and composition are such that Forrest occupies most of the frame, drawing the viewer's attention directly to him and his expression.

In the background, there's a lamp casting a soft glow, and a window with curtains partially drawn, suggesting it might be night outside. The color palette is dominated by shades of white and black, creating a stark contrast that enhances the dramatic effect of the scene.

Forrest's body language and gestures are subtle yet expressive. He lies still on his back, arms relaxed at his sides. His facial expression is one of deep thought or perhaps regret, hinting at the complex emotions he might be experiencing.

As for props and costumes, Forrest is dressed in a simple white shirt which stands out against the dark surroundings. The room itself is sparsely furnished, with the bed being the most prominent piece of furniture.

The depth of field is shallow, focusing on Forrest while keeping the background slightly blurred. This technique helps to isolate him further and draws attention to his expression.

Visual effects are minimal but effective in this scene. The overall lighting effect gives a dreamlike quality to the image, enhancing the emotional impact without detracting from the realism of the scene.

Overall, the film-maker has used a combination of facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, composition, setting, color, body language, props, and visual effects to create a powerful and evocative scene that leaves a lasting impression.

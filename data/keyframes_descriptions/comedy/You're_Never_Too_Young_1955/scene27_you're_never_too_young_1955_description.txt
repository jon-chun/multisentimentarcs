In the image, actor Michael Stuhlbarg is captured in a scene from the movie "The Good Girl". He is standing in a room painted with blue walls. The room is adorned with a white chandelier hanging from the ceiling and a mirror mounted on the wall. Stuhlbarg, dressed in a light blue suit complemented by a red bowtie, holds a cane in his right hand. His facial expression suggests deep thought as he gazes into the distance.

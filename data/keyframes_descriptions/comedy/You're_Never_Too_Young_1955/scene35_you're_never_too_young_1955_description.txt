The image captures a moment between two men in a barber shop. The man on the left, dressed in a white shirt and blue pants, is seated comfortably in a brown barber chair. His gaze is directed towards the right, where another man stands behind him.

This second man, wearing a white lab coat and a black bowtie, holds a pair of scissors in his hand. His posture suggests he is about to cut the hair of the seated man. The barber shop itself is characterized by a gray wall adorned with white blinds. A shelf filled with various bottles and jars can be seen in the background, adding to the ambiance of the setting.

In the image, we see a scene from the movie "The Great Gatsby" featuring actors Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan. Tobey Maguire, portraying the character of Nick Carraway, is seated at a desk in a room adorned with blue curtains. He is dressed in a white shirt and a blue tie, holding a glass of whiskey in his hand. Standing next to him is Carey Mulligan, who plays the character of Jordan Belfort. She is wearing a red dress and has her hands on her hips. The overall color scheme of the image is dominated by shades of blue and gray, with the exception of Jordan's red dress providing a striking contrast.

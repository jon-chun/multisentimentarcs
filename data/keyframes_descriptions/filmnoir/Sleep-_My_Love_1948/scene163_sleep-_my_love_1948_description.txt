This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Help". The image captures a moment between two characters, Aibileen Clark (played by Queen Latifah) and Lily Owens (played by Sophie Okonedo). Aibileen, dressed in a light-colored blouse with dark buttons, stands on the left side of the frame. She is looking at Lily, who is seated on the right side of the frame. Lily is wearing a darker-colored dress and also appears to be looking at Aibileen. The setting is an indoor room with a window visible in the background. The overall composition of the image suggests a serious and intense conversation between the two characters.

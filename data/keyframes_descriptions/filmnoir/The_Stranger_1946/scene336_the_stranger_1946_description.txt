This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street at night. The scene is set in front of a building with columns, which has a large window on the left side. 

In the center of the image, a man dressed in a suit and hat is walking towards the camera. He carries a briefcase in his hand, suggesting he might be returning from work or heading to an important meeting. His posture and attire give him an air of confidence and authority.

To the right of the man, there's another individual who appears to be walking away from the camera. This person is dressed more casually, wearing a t-shirt and jeans. Their relaxed demeanor contrasts with the formal appearance of the man in the suit.

On the left side of the image, two cars are parked on the street. One car has its headlights on, casting a soft glow that illuminates the immediate surroundings. The other car's headlights are off, adding to the overall darkness of the scene.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the building and gives a sense of scale to the scene. This perspective also places the viewer in the position of looking up at the man in the suit, further enhancing his imposing presence.

Overall, this image tells a story of contrast - between formal and casual attire, between light and dark, and between movement and stillness. It's a snapshot of life in the city, captured in black and white for added dramatic effect.

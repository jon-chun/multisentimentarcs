This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between two men. The man on the left, donned in a suit and hat, stands behind a desk that holds a typewriter. His gaze is directed towards the man on the right, who is seated at the desk. The background reveals a window with trees outside, adding depth to the scene. The monochrome palette enhances the timeless quality of this moment.

Behind the clock, a figure stands out in black silhouette. This could be a person or perhaps a statue, but the details are obscured by the darkness. The figure's position behind the clock gives it an air of mystery and intrigue.

The background is shrouded in darkness, adding to the overall dramatic effect of the image. Despite the lack of color, the contrast between light and dark creates a sense of depth and dimensionality.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of timelessness and mystery, with the black and white palette enhancing its dramatic effect. The precise positioning of the objects and their interplay with light and shadow adds to the intrigue of the scene.

The man is dressed in a suit and tie, suggesting a formal or special occasion. He holds the reins of the horse with his left hand, indicating that he is guiding it.

The setting is a park-like environment, characterized by trees on either side of the path. The trees are tall and provide a canopy over the path, creating a sense of depth in the image. The sky above is clear, suggesting it might be a bright day.

The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actress Marlene Dietrich. She is seated in a chair, her head tilted slightly to the side as she gazes off into the distance with a pensive expression on her face. The background is blurred, drawing focus to her figure. Her attire consists of a plaid shawl draped over her shoulders and a pearl necklace adorning her neck. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to the scene.

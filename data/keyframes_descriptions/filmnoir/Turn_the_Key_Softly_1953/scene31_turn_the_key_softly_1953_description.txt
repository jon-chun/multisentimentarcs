The image is a black and white movie still featuring two women. The woman on the left, clad in a gray coat and hat, stands with her hands clasped together in front of her. Her gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting she might be lost in thought or observing something out of frame. 

On the right, another woman is seen wearing a beige dress adorned with a pearl necklace. She holds a black purse in her hand and looks directly at the camera, her expression neutral. The two women are positioned against a backdrop of a brick wall, adding an urban feel to the scene.

The composition of the image places the two women centrally, drawing attention to their expressions and body language. The use of black and white adds a timeless quality to the image, emphasizing the contrast between the light-colored clothing of the women and the dark brick wall behind them. 

Overall, the image captures a moment of quiet introspection, with each woman absorbed in her own world amidst an urban setting.

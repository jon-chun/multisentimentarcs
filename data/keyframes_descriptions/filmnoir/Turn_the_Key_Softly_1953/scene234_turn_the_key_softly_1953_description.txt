The image is a black and white movie still capturing a scene from the film "Rebecca". The central figure in the frame is actress Alida Valli, portraying the character of Danuta Mas≈Çowska. She stands against a backdrop of a brick wall, with a wooden table and chair subtly positioned behind her. Dressed in a long coat and hat, her posture exudes an air of elegance and mystery. Her gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting deep thought or contemplation. The monochrome palette of the image enhances the dramatic tension and adds a timeless quality to the scene.

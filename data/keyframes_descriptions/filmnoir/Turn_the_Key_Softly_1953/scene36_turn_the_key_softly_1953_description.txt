This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Casablanca". The image features three individuals standing in front of a stone archway. 

From left to right, the first person is a woman dressed in a long coat and hat, holding a large bag in her hand. She appears to be walking away from the camera, suggesting movement or departure.

In the middle, there's another woman wearing a short dress and a headscarf. She stands still, creating a contrast with the first woman's action.

On the right, there's a man dressed in a suit and tie. He too is looking away from the camera, mirroring the direction of the first woman.

The stone archway behind them adds an architectural element to the scene, while the black and white color scheme gives the image a timeless quality. The absence of color focuses our attention on the subjects' expressions, body language, and interactions with each other and their environment. 

Please note that this description is based on the visible elements in the image and does not include any speculative or interpretive details.

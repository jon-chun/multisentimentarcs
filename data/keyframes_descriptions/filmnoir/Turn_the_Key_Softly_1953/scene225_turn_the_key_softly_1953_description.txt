The composition is balanced with the woman centrally positioned in the frame. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly a room or studio. The color palette is monochromatic due to the black and white nature of the image. The body language and gestures suggest calmness and composure. There are no props or costumes visible in the image. The depth of field is shallow, with the woman's face sharply in focus while the background is out of focus.

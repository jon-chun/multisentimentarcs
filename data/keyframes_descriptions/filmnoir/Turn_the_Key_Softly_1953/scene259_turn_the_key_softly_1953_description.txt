This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a street. The scene is set at night, with the streetlights casting their glow on the wet pavement below. 

In the foreground, three individuals are present. Two of them are standing near a building that has "Alice" written on it in bold letters. One person is seated on a bench, while the other two stand nearby. The person sitting on the bench appears to be engaged in conversation with one of the standing individuals.

The third person is positioned slightly behind and to the side of the group, adding depth to the composition. 

In the background, a sign for "Albert's" can be seen, suggesting that this scene might be taking place outside a restaurant or bar named after Albert. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a casual, relaxed setting where people are enjoying their time together.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a rainy night in an urban setting. The main subject of the image is a person, standing on the sidewalk next to a street lamp. The person appears to be waiting or perhaps just enjoying the rain. They are dressed in what seems to be a casual outfit, including a backpack that suggests they might be a student or a traveler.

The background of the image reveals more about the setting. There's a building with a sign that reads "Caf√©", indicating that this scene takes place in a commercial area with businesses open late into the night. The street lamp next to the person provides some illumination, casting long shadows and adding depth to the image.

The photograph is taken from a high angle, looking down on the scene. This perspective gives us a comprehensive view of the setting and allows us to observe the details of the person's attire and posture. Despite being in black and white, the image conveys a sense of calm and tranquility, typical of a rainy night in the city.

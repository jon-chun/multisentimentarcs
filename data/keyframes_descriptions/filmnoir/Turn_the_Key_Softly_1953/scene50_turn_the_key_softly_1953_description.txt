On the left side of the frame, there's a small bus painted in white. It has a black roof and a contrasting black stripe running along its side. This bus appears to be stationary, parked by the curb.

On the right side of the photo, there's a larger bus that stands out due to its vibrant red color. The words "MOTORWAY" are prominently displayed on it in white letters, indicating its function as a public transit vehicle for highways or motorways.

The street itself is lined with buildings and shops, creating an urban backdrop to this scene. A traffic light can be seen in the background, adding to the cityscape atmosphere.

In terms of composition, the buses are positioned diagonally from each other, creating a sense of balance in the image. The stationary white bus on the left contrasts with the moving red bus on the right, adding dynamism to the scene.

Overall, this photograph captures a slice of city life, with its mix of static and dynamic elements, contrasting colors, and urban setting.

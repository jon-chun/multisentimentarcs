This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a bustling street. The main subject of the image is a man, who is walking away from the camera. He is dressed in a hat and coat, suggesting a cool or rainy weather condition. 

In the background, there's a red double-decker bus with the words "Daltons Homes Weekly" written on it. This could indicate that the bus is part of an advertisement campaign for Daltons Homes. The bus is driving past a building adorned with columns, adding to the urban setting of the image.

The photograph appears to be taken from a distance, as evidenced by the slight blur of the man's figure and the bus in the background. This could suggest that the photographer was trying to capture not just the subjects but also their environment.

Despite being a still image, it tells a story of everyday life in a city, with elements like the double-decker bus hinting at the rhythm of urban living. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the photograph, evoking nostalgia or perhaps emphasizing the universality of city life across different eras.

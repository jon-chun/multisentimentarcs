This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in time on a city street. The scene is set at night, with the main focus being a man standing outside a store named "Alice". The store's sign is clearly visible, indicating its presence in the urban landscape.

The man is positioned to the left of the frame, his body oriented towards the right side of the image. His gaze is directed upwards, suggesting he might be looking at something or someone out of the frame. This could indicate a sense of curiosity or anticipation.

In the background, another individual can be seen walking away from the camera. Their presence adds depth to the scene and suggests that this is a public space with foot traffic.

The photograph is taken from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. This perspective allows for a comprehensive view of the surroundings and emphasizes the isolation of the man standing outside "Alice".

Overall, the image evokes a sense of solitude and introspection, as if the man is contemplating something significant in his life while standing alone on this city street at night.

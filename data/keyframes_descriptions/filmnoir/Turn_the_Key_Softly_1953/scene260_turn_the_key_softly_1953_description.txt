This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street at night. The scene is set in front of a building with the words "Alice & Rabbit" written on it, suggesting that this could be a theater or entertainment venue.

In the foreground, there are three individuals engaged in conversation. One person is standing upright, while another is seated on a bench. The third individual is kneeling down, possibly to pick something up from the ground. Their body language suggests they are relaxed and comfortable with each other's company.

The background of the image reveals more about the setting. A street lamp casts light onto the scene, illuminating the people and their surroundings. The building behind them has a sign that reads "Alice & Rabbit", indicating that this could be a popular local spot or landmark.

Despite being in black and white, the photograph is rich in detail and provides a glimpse into a moment of everyday life in this city.

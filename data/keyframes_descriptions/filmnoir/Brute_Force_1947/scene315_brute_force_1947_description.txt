This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in an office setting. The image features two men, each engaged in their own activities.

The man on the left is seated at a desk, which holds a typewriter and a telephone. He is holding a cigarette in his hand, suggesting a relaxed or casual atmosphere. His posture indicates that he is deep in thought, perhaps contemplating something important.

On the right, another man stands behind the seated man. He too holds a cigarette, mirroring the seated man's action. His position suggests he might be observing or waiting for something.

The background of the image reveals a bookshelf filled with books and files, indicating that this is an office environment. The presence of these items also implies that the men are likely engaged in some sort of professional work.

Despite being a black and white image, it's rich in detail and narrative, offering a glimpse into a moment of quiet contemplation or discussion in a professional setting.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of three individuals seated at a table. The man on the right, dressed in a suit, holds a newspaper in his hands. He appears to be engrossed in reading it. Across from him, a woman in a dress is seen holding a cigarette in her hand, suggesting she might be smoking. Between them, another man, also wearing a suit, seems to be engaged in conversation with the woman. The table they are seated at has a stack of papers on it, indicating some sort of work or discussion might be taking place. The background features a window and curtains, providing context that this scene is likely set indoors. The monochrome palette adds a timeless quality to the image.

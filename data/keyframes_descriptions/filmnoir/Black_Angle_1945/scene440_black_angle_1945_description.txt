The image is a black and white photograph capturing a tranquil scene of a car parked on the side of a street. The car, positioned in the center of the frame, faces towards the right side of the image. It's an older model, characterized by its rounded shape and a large trunk at the back.

In the background, there are two trees standing tall. One is located on the left side of the image, while the other is on the right. They add a touch of nature to this urban setting.

The street where the car is parked extends into the distance, leading towards a building that can be seen in the far background. The entire scene is bathed in soft light, creating a serene and peaceful atmosphere. Despite being a black and white image, it's rich in detail and evokes a sense of calmness and quietude.

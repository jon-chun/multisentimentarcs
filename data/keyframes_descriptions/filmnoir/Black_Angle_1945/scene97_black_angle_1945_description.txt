The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of intense emotion. The central figure is a man, dressed in a suit and hat, seated at a desk. His facial expression is one of anger or frustration, as indicated by his furrowed brows and clenched jaw. He holds a telephone receiver to his ear, suggesting he is engaged in a heated conversation.

The camera angle is from the side, providing a profile view of the man's face and upper body. The lighting is dramatic, with light falling on the left side of the image, casting shadows on the right. This creates a stark contrast that further emphasizes the man's intense expression.

The setting appears to be an office or study, characterized by a window in the background and a desk in front of which the man is seated. The overall composition of the image places the man as the focal point, with his actions and expressions dominating the scene.

Despite being a black and white image, the use of light and shadow provides depth and texture to the photograph. The absence of color draws attention to the man's facial expression and body language, further enhancing the emotional impact of the image. The film-maker has skillfully used these elements to create a powerful and evocative scene.

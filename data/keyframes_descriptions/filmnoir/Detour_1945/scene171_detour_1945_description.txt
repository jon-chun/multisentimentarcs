The car, an old model with a shiny exterior, is parked on a dirt road. One man is positioned behind the car, while the other stands in front of it, both appearing to be engaged in conversation.

The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the size and grandeur of the vintage car. The lighting is dramatic, with the car's headlights piercing through the darkness, casting long shadows and creating a sense of depth and contrast.

In terms of composition, the two men are framed by the car, drawing attention to their interaction while also highlighting the car as the central element of the scene. The dirt road in the background provides context for the setting, suggesting a rural or remote location.

The color palette is monochromatic due to the black and white nature of the photograph, but this does not detract from the richness of the scene. The shiny exterior of the car reflects light, adding texture and detail to the image. The men's body language and gestures suggest a casual yet intense conversation, hinting at the depth of their relationship.

Overall, the film-maker has used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and costumes to create a compelling and evocative scene from "Easy Rider".

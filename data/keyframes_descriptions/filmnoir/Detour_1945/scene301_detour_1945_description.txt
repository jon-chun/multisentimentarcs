This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of intense emotion. The central figure in the image is a woman, her face etched with a look of deep sadness or sorrow. She is seated at a table, which is positioned slightly to her left within the frame. On the table, there's a glass ashtray.

The camera angle is from above and slightly to the right, providing a clear view of the woman's face while also capturing the details of the setting. The lighting in the image is dramatic, with light shining directly onto the woman's face, highlighting her expression and creating a stark contrast against the darker background.

The composition of the photograph places the woman as the focal point, with the table and ashtray serving as secondary elements that add context to the scene. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly a room or study, suggested by the presence of the table and the absence of any other identifiable objects in the frame.

Despite being a black and white image, the photograph is rich in detail and emotion, with each element contributing to the overall mood of the piece.

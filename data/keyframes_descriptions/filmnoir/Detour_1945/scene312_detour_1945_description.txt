The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actress Marilyn Monroe. She is holding a telephone receiver to her ear, her gaze directed off to the side with a slight smile playing on her lips. The setting appears to be a room with a window in the background, through which light filters into the scene. The composition of the image places Monroe centrally, drawing attention to her and her actions. Her body language suggests a sense of calm or contemplation. The use of black and white for the photo adds a timeless quality to the image.

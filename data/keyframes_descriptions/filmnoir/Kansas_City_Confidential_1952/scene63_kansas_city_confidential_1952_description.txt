This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in time on a city street. The image features three men, each dressed in dark-colored clothing and hats, walking away from the camera. They are carrying bags, suggesting they might be returning from work or running errands.

The man in the center of the frame stands out due to his slightly different attire compared to the other two men. He is wearing a tie, which distinguishes him from the other two who are not wearing ties.

The setting is an urban environment with a building visible in the background. The photo appears to have been taken during the day, as evidenced by the light illuminating the scene.

Please note that this description is based on the visible elements in the image and does not include any speculative or interpretive details.

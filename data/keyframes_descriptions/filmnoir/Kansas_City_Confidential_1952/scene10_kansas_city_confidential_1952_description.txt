This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The main subject of the image is a vintage car, which is parked on the right side of the frame. The car's design suggests it could be from an earlier era.

In front of the car, there are four individuals standing on the sidewalk. They appear to be engaged in conversation with each other. Their exact actions or expressions are not discernible due to the still nature of the image.

The background of the image reveals a cityscape with buildings and trees lining the street. The presence of these elements suggests that this scene takes place in an urban setting, possibly during the day given the visibility of the surroundings.

Please note that as this is a black and white photo, specific colors cannot be determined. Also, due to the still nature of the image, certain aspects like facial expressions or body language can't be precisely analyzed.

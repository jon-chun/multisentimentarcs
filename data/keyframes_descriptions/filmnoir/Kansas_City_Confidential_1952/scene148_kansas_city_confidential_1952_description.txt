This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment at the entrance of a hotel. The image is taken from a low angle, emphasizing the grandeur of the building. Two men are present in the frame, one on the left and the other on the right. 

The man on the left is dressed in a suit and hat, holding a briefcase in his hand. His posture suggests he might be arriving for a business meeting or departing after one. The man on the right is wearing a fedora and also holds a briefcase, indicating a similar professional status.

The hotel entrance behind them features a sign that reads "HOTEL", confirming their location. A large window forms part of the building's facade, reflecting the surrounding cityscape. The photograph is taken at night, with streetlights casting an even light on the scene.

Despite being in black and white, the image conveys a sense of timelessness and sophistication. The men's attire and props hint at a bygone era, while the modern hotel sign suggests a blend of old and new. The low angle shot adds to the dramatic effect, making the viewer feel as if they are standing right there on that city street, looking up at those two men against the backdrop of the grand hotel entrance.

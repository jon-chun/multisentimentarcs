The image presents a black and white photograph of the exterior of the Southwest Bank. The bank's name is prominently displayed in large, capitalized letters above two windows. Each window has a sign that reads "Safe Deposit Boxes", indicating the purpose of the boxes within. The windows are situated on either side of the bank's name, creating a symmetrical visual effect. The photograph appears to be taken from a slightly elevated angle, providing a clear view of the bank's signage and the two safe deposit box windows. The absence of color in the image focuses attention on the shapes and text within it, emphasizing the bank's identity and purpose.

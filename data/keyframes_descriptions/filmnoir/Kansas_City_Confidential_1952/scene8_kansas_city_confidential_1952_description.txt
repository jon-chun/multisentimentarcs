The image is a black and white photograph of the exterior of the Southwest Bank Trust Savings Association. The bank's name is prominently displayed on a sign above two windows, which are labeled "Safe Deposit" and "Books". The building itself has a dark facade with vertical blinds partially drawn over the windows. The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of security and trust associated with the bank. The use of black and white adds a timeless quality to the image, emphasizing the bank's longstanding presence in the community.

The image is a black and white movie still featuring two men in suits. The man on the left, donned in a fedora hat, is looking off to the side with a serious expression. On the right, another man, wearing a suit and tie, is looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. They are standing in front of a sign that reads "Esquipulas de Cacao y Frutas y Baggage Claim Ticketing y Pasaje Salida y Aduanas". The background consists of a wall adorned with a window and a door. The overall composition suggests a formal or professional setting, possibly related to the transportation industry given the presence of the baggage claim sign.

The image is a black and white movie still that captures the title card of a film. The title card is written in white text against a black background, giving it a stark contrast for easy readability. The title card lists the names of the cast members and crew involved in the film.

The cast members listed include Joe Rafe, Helen Foster, Tim Foster, Tony Kano, Pete Harris, Teresa Tomasso, Andrews, Martin Diaz, Morrelli, John Payne, Colleen Gray, Preston Foster, Lee Van Cleef, Jack Elam, Donna Drake, Mario Siletti, Howard Negley, Carleton Young, and Don Orlando. Each name is listed in a separate line, with the last name being "Ted Ryan". The names are arranged in a vertical column down the center of the image.

The text is written in a simple sans-serif font, which adds to the overall minimalist aesthetic of the title card. Despite the lack of color and additional elements, the title card effectively conveys the information it needs to, making it an essential part of any film's presentation.

The image captures a scene from the movie "Casablanca" featuring actors Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Bogart, donned in a fedora hat and a trench coat, is seated at a table with two glasses of wine in front of him. He holds a glass of wine in his right hand. Across from him, Bergman is seen wearing a headscarf and a long coat. She too holds a glass of wine in her left hand. The background reveals a dimly lit room adorned with shelves filled with bottles and various other items. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a quiet and intimate conversation between the two characters.

The image is a black and white movie still capturing a moment between two men in suits. The man on the left, dressed in a gray suit with a white shirt and a black tie, stands slightly behind the man on the right. The man on the right, wearing a dark suit with a white shirt and a black tie, looks at the man on the left who is looking off to the side. They are positioned against a brick wall with a window in the background. The image evokes a sense of tension or disagreement between the two men.

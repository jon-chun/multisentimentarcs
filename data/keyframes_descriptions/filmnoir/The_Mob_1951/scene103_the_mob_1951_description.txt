On the right side of the frame is Al Pacino, playing Michael Corleone. He is also dressed in a suit and a fedora hat, but unlike Brando's character, he is not holding a glass of wine. His facial expression mirrors that of Brondo's, suggesting that he too is involved in the conflict.

The room they are in has a rustic charm with its stone walls and wooden furniture. The lighting is dim, adding to the intensity of the scene. The composition of the image places the two characters at the center, drawing attention to their expressions and actions.

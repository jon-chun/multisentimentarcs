He is wearing a light-colored shirt and has his hands clasped together in front of him. The bar itself is well-stocked with various bottles and glasses arranged on it. A clock hangs on the wall in the background, adding to the ambiance of the scene. The man's posture suggests he might be waiting or preparing for something. The overall composition of the image gives a sense of calm and anticipation.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a scene on a city street at night. The main focus of the image is a bus stop, which is located in the center of the frame. A signpost stands prominently at the bus stop, bearing the word "Central". 

In the background, there are several buildings visible, including one that has a neon sign with the word "Budweiser" on it. The street itself is wet, reflecting the lights from the surrounding buildings and cars.

There are two cars in the image - one is parked at the bus stop while the other is driving past. A traffic cone is placed on the sidewalk near the bus stop, possibly indicating some sort of road work or restriction.

The photograph appears to have been taken from a low angle, as evidenced by the slightly tilted perspective and the inclusion of the photographer's hand in the bottom left corner of the frame. This suggests that the photo was likely taken with a camera mounted on a tripod or similar device.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of quiet solitude typical of city streets at night, with the bus stop serving as a focal point amidst the urban landscape.

In the image, there are two individuals seated at a table in what appears to be a restaurant or bar setting. The person on the left is dressed in a black tuxedo and has short dark hair. They are looking off to the side with a slight smile on their face. On the right, the other individual is wearing a blue dress adorned with a silver flower brooch. They are looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression.

The table between them holds a wine glass and a candle, suggesting a romantic or celebratory occasion. The background reveals more of the restaurant setting with additional people and tables visible. The overall atmosphere seems to be one of social interaction and enjoyment.

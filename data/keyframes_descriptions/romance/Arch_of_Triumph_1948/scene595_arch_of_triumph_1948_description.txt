The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the man's face. This perspective adds a sense of grandeur and importance to the subject, further emphasizing his role as the focal point of the image.

The background is dark and out of focus, which helps to draw attention to the man and creates a stark contrast that highlights his figure. The lack of color in the photograph adds a timeless quality to the image, evoking a sense of nostalgia or reminiscence.

The use of black and white adds depth and complexity to the photograph, while the man's bow tie suggests a sense of formality or occasion. The low-angle shot gives the man an imposing presence, further emphasizing his role as the central figure in this image.

The image presents a black and white photograph of an analog clock face, which is the central focus. The clock face is round with a white background and black numbers and hands. The numbers are in Roman numerals and range from 1 to 12. The time displayed on the clock is 10:30.

The clock is mounted on a wall that has a black background. On this wall, there are two other clocks visible. One of these clocks is round like the main one, while the other one is square. 

In addition to the clocks, there's also a white text visible in the image. The word "Jager" is written in white against a black background.

The overall composition of the image suggests a focus on time and its passage, as indicated by the presence of multiple clocks. The use of black and white adds a timeless quality to the photograph.

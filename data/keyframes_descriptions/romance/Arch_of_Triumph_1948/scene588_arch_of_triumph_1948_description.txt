The image is a black and white photograph capturing the face of a car's dashboard. The dashboard, which is the central focus of the image, features a speedometer with numbers ranging from 0 to 60. The number "817119" prominently stands out on the speedometer. Above the speedometer, there are two smaller gauges indicating the temperature and fuel level.

The background of the image is blurred, drawing attention back to the dashboard. Despite the blur, it's discernible that the setting appears to be a car interior. The absence of color in the photograph adds a timeless quality to the scene.

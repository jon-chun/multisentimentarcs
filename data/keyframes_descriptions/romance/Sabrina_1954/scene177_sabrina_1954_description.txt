She holds a pearl necklace delicately in her hand, adding to her poised demeanor. Her gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting she might be lost in thought or observing something outside the frame.

The room around her is filled with various objects that contribute to its ambiance. A bookshelf stands against one wall, housing an array of books and knick-knacks. Nearby, a table holds a vase filled with flowers, adding a touch of nature to the indoor setting. The window behind the woman lets in light that illuminates the room, casting shadows and highlighting details.

This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Godfather". The scene takes place in a car, with three characters present: Don Vito Corleone, Michael Corleone, and Fredo Corleone. 

Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is seated in the driver's seat. He is wearing a suit and tie, and his facial expression is serious as he looks at Michael.

Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, is sitting in the passenger seat. He is also dressed in a suit and tie, and his gaze is directed towards Fredo.

Fredo Corleone, played by John Cazale, is in the backseat. He is wearing a black shirt and his facial expression is one of sadness as he looks down.

The car is parked in front of a building with a wooden door and window. The lighting in the scene is dim, adding to the dramatic atmosphere of the image. The composition of the photo places Don Vito in the center, drawing attention to him as the main character of this scene. The black and white color scheme enhances the mood and intensity of the scene.

The image is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The main focus of the image is Ingrid Bergman, portraying the character Ilsa Lund. She is standing in front of a car with a man leaning on it. Ilsa is dressed in a red plaid shirt and shorts, holding a cigarette in her hand. Her facial expression is one of concern or worry as she looks at the man. The setting appears to be a courtyard with arches in the background. The overall composition of the image suggests a tense moment between the two characters.

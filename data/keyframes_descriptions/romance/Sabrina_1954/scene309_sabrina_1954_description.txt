The image is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The scene captures a moment between two characters, Rick Blaine (played by Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (played by Ingrid Bergman). They are standing in front of a large window that offers a view of the cityscape. 

Rick is dressed in a white suit adorned with blue polka dots, while Ilsa is wearing a black dress. Both characters have facial expressions indicative of sadness or pensiveness. The camera angle is from a low angle, looking up at Rick and Ilsa, which adds to the dramatic effect of the scene. The lighting is diffused, casting soft shadows and highlighting the characters' faces.

The framing of the image places Rick and Ilsa in the center, drawing attention to their expressions and body language. The large window behind them serves as a backdrop, its vastness emphasizing the depth of the scene. The cityscape outside the window adds context to the setting but remains out of focus, further highlighting the characters.

The color palette is monochromatic due to the black and white nature of the photo. However, the contrast between Rick's white suit and Ilsa's black dress creates a visual focal point.

Rick's body language suggests he is deep in thought, while Ilsa's expression indicates she is lost in her own thoughts as well. Their positioning relative to each other and their individual expressions create a sense of tension and intimacy within the scene.

The props and costumes are minimalistic yet effective. Rick's white suit with blue polka dots stands out against the grayscale backdrop, while Ilsa's black dress adds contrast to the scene.

The depth of field is shallow, focusing on Rick and Ilsa while keeping the background in focus. This technique draws attention to the characters and their expressions while still providing context through the cityscape outside the window.

Overall, the film-maker has used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, costumes, depth of field, character positioning, and interaction to create a powerful and evocative scene.

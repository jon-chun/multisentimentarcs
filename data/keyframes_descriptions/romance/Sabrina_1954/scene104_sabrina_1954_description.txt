The image is a black and white photograph capturing the exterior of the Larrabee Paper Co. The main focus of the image is a signboard mounted on a brick wall, which lists the names of various companies associated with Larrabee Paper Co. These include "LARRABEE", "Tool Co.", "Ship 22", "The Copper Co.", and "The Larrabee Foundation". 

The photograph is taken from a low angle, directing the viewer's gaze upwards towards the signboard. This perspective emphasizes the signboard and its list of companies, making it the central element in the composition. The brick wall provides a textured backdrop that contrasts with the smooth surface of the signboard.

Despite being a black and white image, the photograph conveys a sense of history and tradition through its subject matter - a paper company named Larrabee Paper Co. The absence of color focuses attention on the text and shapes within the image, creating a visually engaging composition that tells a story about the company's associations with other businesses.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a room. The room is furnished with a piano, a chair, and a bench. 

In the foreground, a woman dressed in a white blouse adorned with blue flowers is seated at the piano. She appears to be playing the instrument, her fingers dancing over the keys.

Standing behind her is another woman, clad in a black dress and hat. Her posture suggests she is observing the pianist, perhaps offering silent support or simply enjoying the music.

The room itself is dimly lit, with light filtering through a window in the background. The overall composition of the image creates a sense of intimacy and focus on the piano player, while also subtly highlighting the presence of the observer in the background.

This is a black and white movie still from the film "A Place in the Sun". The scene captures a moment of quiet intimacy between two characters, George Aplin (played by Gregory Peck) and Alice Aylward (played by Elizabeth Taylor). They are seated at a table in a garden setting. George, dressed in a crisp white shirt and black tie, holds a glass of wine in his hand. Across from him, Alice is attired in a white dress and also holds a glass of wine. The image evokes a sense of nostalgia and longing, as the characters seem to be sharing a moment of connection amidst the grandeur of their surroundings.

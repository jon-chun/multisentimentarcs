The image is a black and white movie still from the film "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" featuring the actress Elizabeth Taylor in her role as Martha. She is seated at a table, holding a drink in her hand. The setting appears to be a restaurant or bar, with other patrons visible in the background. The photo captures her from behind and slightly to the left, providing a profile view of her face. The monochrome palette adds a timeless quality to the scene.

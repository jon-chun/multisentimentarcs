This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of three individuals seated at a table. The table, draped in a white tablecloth, serves as the central focus of the image. 

On the left side of the table, there's an individual donned in a white lab coat, their hand delicately holding a wine glass. In the middle, another person is seen wearing a white blouse, with a cigarette casually resting between their fingers. To the right, the third person is dressed in a gray suit and holds a drink in their hand.

The background features a window adorned with curtains, adding depth to the scene. The monochrome palette of the photograph enhances the timeless quality of this captured moment.

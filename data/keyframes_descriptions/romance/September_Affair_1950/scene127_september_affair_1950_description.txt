This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Grand Budapest Hotel". The image features two characters, Agatha and Dmitri Desgoffe-und-Taxis. Agatha, positioned on the left side of the frame, is dressed in a floral patterned dress and a black hat, holding a small vase in her hand. On the right side of the frame, Dmitri is seen wearing a black suit and a white shirt, holding a drink in his hand. The setting appears to be a room with a large window in the background. The photograph is taken from a low angle, giving an upward perspective to the characters. The monochrome color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene.

The image is a black and white movie still capturing a moment between two men. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and tie, is seated with his legs crossed. He appears to be engaged in conversation with the man on the right, who is wearing a collared shirt and has his arms resting on his knees. They are positioned in front of a window, which serves as the backdrop for this scene. The overall composition suggests an atmosphere of seriousness and intensity.

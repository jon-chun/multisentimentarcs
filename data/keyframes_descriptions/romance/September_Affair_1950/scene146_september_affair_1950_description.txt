This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The scene is set in front of an ornate building, which features columns and statues adorning its facade. 

In the center of the image, a horse-drawn carriage commands attention. The carriage is being pulled by two horses, one on each side. The driver, dressed in a white shirt and black pants, sits atop the carriage, guiding the horses.

On either side of the street, pedestrians are going about their day. One individual can be seen walking towards the camera, while another person is captured mid-stride, moving away from the camera. 

The photograph is taken from an elevated angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene below. This perspective allows for a comprehensive view of the street and its surroundings.

Despite being in black and white, the image is rich in detail and evokes a sense of nostalgia, transporting the viewer back to a time when horse-drawn carriages were a common sight on city streets.

In the black and white photograph, a man with a beard is the central figure. He is engaged in a phone conversation, holding a phone to his ear. His attire consists of a collared shirt, adding a formal touch to his appearance. The setting appears to be indoors, as suggested by the presence of a wall in the background.

The composition of the image places the man slightly off-center, creating an interesting visual dynamic. The camera angle is particularly noteworthy, taken from a low angle looking up at the man, which adds a sense of depth and perspective to the photograph.

The lighting in the image is diffused, softening the overall look and feel of the photograph. This choice of lighting contributes to the timeless quality of the image.

In terms of color, the absence of color due to the black and white nature of the photograph enhances the contrast and texture within the image. The man's facial expression, body language, and gestures all contribute to a sense of intrigue and mystery about his character.

The props in the image are minimalistic - just the phone held by the man. His costume is simple yet elegant, consisting only of a collared shirt.

The depth of field in this photograph is shallow, with the man sharply in focus while the background is slightly blurred. This effect draws attention to the man and his actions, making him the undeniable focal point of the image.

Overall, the film-maker has used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, depth of field, character positioning, visual effects, and post-processing to create a captivating and intriguing photograph.

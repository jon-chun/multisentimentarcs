The image is a movie poster for the film "His Girl Friday". The background of the poster is black, providing a stark contrast to the white text and images displayed on it. 

At the top of the poster, there's a red banner with the words "Enjoy Classic Hollywood Films" written in white letters. Just below this banner, there's an image of Cary Grant, the lead actor of the film, who is depicted wearing a black suit and a red hat. 

Next to Cary Grant, there's an image of Rosalind Russell, another key actress in the film. She is shown wearing a blue dress. The two images are placed side by side, creating a sense of balance in the composition.

In the center of the poster, there's a red and white movie reel symbolizing the film itself. Below this reel, there's a yellow banner with the words "100s of Movies FREE" written in black letters. This suggests that the film is available to watch for free on YouTube.

At the bottom of the poster, there's a blue banner with the text "Visit Our Channel @fulllengthmoviehouse" also in white letters. This invites viewers to visit the channel mentioned for more information or to watch other films.

Overall, the poster uses color and placement of images effectively to convey information about the film and its availability. The use of iconic Hollywood actors like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell adds a touch of nostalgia and classic cinema charm to the design.

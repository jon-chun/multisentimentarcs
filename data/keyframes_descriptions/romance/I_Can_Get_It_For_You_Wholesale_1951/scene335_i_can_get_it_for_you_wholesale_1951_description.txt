This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two women in a room. The woman on the left, dressed in a dark-colored dress with a collar, is holding a coat over her shoulder. She stands slightly behind the other woman, who is positioned to the right of the frame. This second woman is wearing a patterned blouse and has her gaze directed downwards towards the floor. The room they are in features a door and a window in the background, adding depth to the scene. The monochrome palette enhances the timeless quality of this snapshot.

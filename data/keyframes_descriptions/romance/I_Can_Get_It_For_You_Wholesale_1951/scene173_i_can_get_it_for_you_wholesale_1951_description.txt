The image captures a moment from the movie "Casablanca" featuring actors Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains. The scene takes place in a grand room adorned with curtains and a chandelier, adding an air of elegance to the setting. Ingrid Bergman, dressed in a black dress, is seated at a table draped with a white tablecloth. She holds a glass of wine delicately in her hand, her gaze directed towards Claude Rains who is standing behind her. He is attired in a suit and tie, holding a candle that casts a warm glow on his face. The monochrome palette of the photograph enhances the timeless quality of this cinematic classic.

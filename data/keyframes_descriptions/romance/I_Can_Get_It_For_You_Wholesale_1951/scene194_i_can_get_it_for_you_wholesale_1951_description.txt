The man, positioned on the left side of the frame, is dressed in a formal attire consisting of a suit and tie.

The room they are in has curtains and a window, adding depth to the scene. The curtains frame the characters and add a sense of space to the image. The window allows for natural light to filter into the room, illuminating the characters and creating contrast within the black and white color scheme.

The use of black and white adds a timeless quality to the scene, focusing the viewer's attention on the characters and their interaction rather than on colors or other visual distractions.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a dressing room. The central figures are two women, one of whom is adjusting the dress of the other. The woman being adjusted is standing on a chair, her posture relaxed as she allows the other to make adjustments to her dress. The second woman, dressed in a blouse and tie, stands on the floor, her attention focused on the task at hand.

The room around them is filled with various elements that add depth to the scene. A mirror hangs on the wall behind them, reflecting the light from the window above it. The window itself is partially obscured by curtains, adding a sense of softness to the otherwise stark setting. 

In the background, clothes hang neatly on a rack, their presence suggesting a professional environment. Despite the monochrome palette of the photograph, the scene is rich in detail and emotion, each element contributing to the overall narrative of the image.

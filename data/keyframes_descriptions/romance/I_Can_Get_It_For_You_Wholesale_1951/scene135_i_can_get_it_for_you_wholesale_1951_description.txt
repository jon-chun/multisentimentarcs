This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The image features two men, both dressed in suits, walking away from the camera. They are positioned on the right side of the frame, moving towards the left. 

The man in the foreground is slightly ahead of the other man, suggesting they might be in mid-stride or perhaps engaged in conversation. Both men are wearing hats, adding to their formal attire.

In the background, there's a car parked on the street. The car has a sign that reads "CITY TAXI", indicating it's likely a taxi cab. 

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the men. This perspective gives a sense of scale and importance to the subjects, making them appear larger than life.

The lighting in the image is diffused, creating a soft glow that illuminates the scene without harsh shadows or highlights. The absence of color in the photo focuses our attention on the shapes, textures, and contrasts within the frame.

Overall, this image evokes a sense of nostalgia and tells a story of two men going about their day in an urban setting.

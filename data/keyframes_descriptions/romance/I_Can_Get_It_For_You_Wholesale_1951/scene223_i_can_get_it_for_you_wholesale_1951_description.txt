The image captures a moment from the classic film "Casablanca". In this black and white still, we see Humphrey Bogart, portraying the character of Rick Blaine, seated at a desk in his office. He is dressed in a suit and tie, embodying the formal attire of the era. On the other side of the desk, Bergman, played by Claude Rains, is seen wearing a white dress adorned with a flower on her hair. The setting is an office, complete with a window and a plant in the background, adding to the authenticity of the scene. The monochrome palette enhances the timeless quality of this cinematic masterpiece.

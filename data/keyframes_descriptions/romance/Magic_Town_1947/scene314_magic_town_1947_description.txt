This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in front of a wooden fence. The man on the left, dressed in a black suit, holds a book in his hand. He stands slightly behind the other man, who is positioned to the right. This second man is attired in a gray suit and tie, and he holds a cup of tea in his hand. Both men are looking off to the side, their attention seemingly drawn away from the camera. The background reveals a garden with trees and bushes, adding depth to the scene. The overall composition suggests a quiet, introspective moment shared between the two individuals.

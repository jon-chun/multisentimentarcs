The image captures a scene from the movie "Sunrise" featuring the actress Shirley MacLaine. She is seated on a bed, her body oriented towards the left side of the frame. Her attire consists of a purple dress and she holds a white cup in her hands. The room around her is dimly lit, with a coat rack visible in the background. A poster of a man's face adorns the wall behind her. The overall color palette of the image is muted, with the exception of Shirley MacLaine's vibrant purple dress which stands out prominently.

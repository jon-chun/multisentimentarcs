He's dressed in a blue sweater and black pants, adding to the overall muted color palette of the scene.

The desk is adorned with various objects that add depth to the character and setting. A lamp casts a warm glow on the desk, illuminating Oldman's workspace. A picture frame rests on the desk, perhaps holding memories or mementos significant to Mank's life. A statue stands nearby, its presence adding an artistic touch to the room.

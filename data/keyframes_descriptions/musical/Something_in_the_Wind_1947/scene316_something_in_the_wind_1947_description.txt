The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actress Marilyn Monroe. She is standing in front of a mirror, her reflection clearly visible. Her gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting she might be lost in thought or observing something out of frame. The background features a clock with its hands pointing to 7:20, indicating that it's either early morning or late evening. Monroe is dressed in a strapless dress and has her hair styled in loose curls, typical of her iconic style. The overall composition of the image places Monroe as the central focus, with the mirror reflecting her image and the clock serving as an interesting backdrop.

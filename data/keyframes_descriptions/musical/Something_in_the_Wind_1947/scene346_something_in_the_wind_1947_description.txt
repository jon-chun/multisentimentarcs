This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Power of the Dog". The scene takes place in a room with a desk, a chair, and a window. 

In the foreground, there are three characters: two men and one woman. The woman, dressed in a black dress and hat, stands behind the desk. She is holding a pen in her hand, suggesting she might be writing or drawing something. Her posture is upright and confident.

To her right, there's a man wearing a suit and tie. He stands with his hands tucked into his pockets, exuding an air of nonchalance. His gaze seems to be directed towards the woman, indicating some form of interaction between them.

On the left side of the desk, another man is seated in a chair. He appears to be engrossed in reading a book that's placed on the desk. His focused expression suggests he might be deeply absorbed in the content of the book.

The room itself has a window and a door visible in the background, providing context to the setting. The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the scene, enhancing the dramatic effect of the characters' expressions and actions. 

Overall, this image captures a moment of quiet intensity between the three characters, with each one engaged in their own activity yet connected by their shared environment.

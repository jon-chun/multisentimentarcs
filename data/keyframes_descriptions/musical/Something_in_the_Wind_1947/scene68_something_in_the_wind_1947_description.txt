This image captures a moment from the classic film "Rebecca" featuring the actress Alida Valli. The scene takes place in a room with a white door and a window adorned with white curtains. Alida Valli, dressed in a black dress and sporting a pearl necklace, stands on the left side of the frame, her gaze directed towards the right. On the right side of the image, a man is seen playing the violin. The monochrome palette of the photograph enhances its timeless appeal.

The man on the left, dressed in a suit and tie, leans over the table, his attention riveted to the book. His posture suggests a sense of urgency or importance to the task at hand.

On the right, another man is seen wearing a shirt and tie. He holds the book open with both hands, indicating a collaborative effort between the two individuals. His body language reflects a deep engagement with the material being discussed.

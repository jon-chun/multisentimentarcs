The image captures a moment from the movie "Casablanca" featuring actors Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. The scene unfolds in a dimly lit room, with a table at its center. On this table, two glasses of water are placed, one on each side. 

Bogart, dressed in a black suit and tie, stands on the left side of the frame. His gaze is directed towards Bergman, who is seated on the right side of the image. She is attired in a white dress and holds a glass of water in her hand.

The background reveals a bookshelf filled with various books, adding an intellectual ambiance to the setting. A window can also be seen, subtly hinting at the world outside this intimate scene. The overall composition of the image suggests a quiet moment of conversation or contemplation between the two characters.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between two individuals. The person on the left, donned in a suit and hat, is holding a cup in their hand. On the right, another individual, wearing a dress and a hat, is seen holding a parasol. They are seated on a bench, with the backdrop featuring a building and trees. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to this candid moment.

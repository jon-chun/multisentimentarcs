The scene takes place in a room adorned with posters on the wall, under a chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Bogart, dressed in a suit and tie, is seated at a table, holding a glass of wine in his hand. Beside him, Bergman is seen wearing a black dress, her attention seemingly focused on something off-camera. The overall color palette of the image is muted, with the exception of the vibrant red flowers that add a pop of color to the scene. The composition and framing of the shot emphasize the characters' expressions and body language, hinting at the intensity of their emotions during this pivotal moment in the film.

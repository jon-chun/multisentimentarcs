This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a car. The image features two individuals, both donned in hats, seated in the back of the car. 

The person on the left is dressed in a light-colored suit, while the individual on the right is attired in a dark-colored outfit. Both are looking towards the camera, their expressions neutral.

The car they're in has an open door, suggesting it might be parked or stationary at the time this photo was taken. The background of the image reveals a street lined with trees and buildings, indicating that the car could be parked on a city street or perhaps in a residential area.

Please note that as this is a black and white image, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the contrast between light and dark clothing provides some visual distinction between the two individuals.

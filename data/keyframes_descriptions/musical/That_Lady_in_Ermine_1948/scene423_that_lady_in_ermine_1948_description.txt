In the image, actor Colin Clive is portraying the character of Baron Frankenstein in the movie "Frankenstein". He is standing to the left of a bed on which lies his character, Count Orlok. Colin Clive is dressed in a black coat adorned with gold epaulettes and a white wig, holding a cane in his right hand. His facial expression is one of concern as he looks down at Count Orlok. The setting is a room decorated with blue wallpaper featuring a floral pattern, and a chandelier hangs from the ceiling.

Overall, the image effectively uses facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, color, body language, props, and costumes to convey the emotions and sentiments evoked by the film-maker. The use of visual effects and post-processing techniques has been used sparingly, ensuring that the focus remains on the actors and their expressions.

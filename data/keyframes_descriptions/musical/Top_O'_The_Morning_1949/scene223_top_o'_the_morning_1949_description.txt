This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a room. The room is furnished with a desk, a chair, and a window. 

In the foreground, there's a man standing up. He's wearing a suit and has his hand on his head, suggesting he might be deep in thought or making a decision.

In the background, another man is seated at the desk. He's dressed casually in a t-shirt and appears to be engrossed in reading a newspaper. 

The room itself is dimly lit, adding an air of seriousness to the scene. The window has blinds on it, further emphasizing the indoor setting. 

Please note that as this is a black and white image, specific colors cannot be determined. However, the varying shades of gray add depth and contrast to the photograph.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in time on a city street. The main focus of the image is a stone cross, standing tall on a small pedestal with steps leading up to it. The cross, made of light-colored stone, has intricate carvings adorning its surface.

In the background, there's a building with a peaked roof and a chimney, adding to the urban setting. A tree stands next to the building, providing a touch of nature amidst the cityscape.

The street is not deserted; several people can be seen walking on it. Their faces are blurred, preserving their anonymity in this captured moment. The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of calm and tranquility, despite being set in an urban environment.

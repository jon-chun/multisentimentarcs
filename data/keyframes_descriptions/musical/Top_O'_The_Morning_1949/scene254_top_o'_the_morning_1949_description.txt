This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in military uniforms. The man on the left, distinguished by his white mustache, stands with his hands confidently placed on his hips. His gaze is directed towards the right, suggesting he might be addressing someone or something out of frame. 

On the right, another man is seen wearing a black beret, adding to the formal attire of both men. He too looks off to the right, mirroring the stance of the first man and creating a sense of symmetry in the image.

The background features a brick wall with a window, providing a simple yet effective backdrop that doesn't distract from the subjects of the photograph. The absence of color in the image puts emphasis on the contrast between light and dark areas, enhancing the dramatic effect of the scene.

Overall, this image evokes a sense of formality and discipline, likely reflecting the military context of the two men's attire and demeanor.

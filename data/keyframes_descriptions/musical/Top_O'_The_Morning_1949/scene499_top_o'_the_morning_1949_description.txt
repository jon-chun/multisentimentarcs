The image is a black and white photograph capturing a close-up view of a tree trunk. The tree trunk, serving as the main subject of the image, is adorned with two heart-shaped cutouts, each containing a single letter - "C" and "M". These letters are not merely carved into the bark but are artistically rendered in a cursive style, adding a touch of elegance to the otherwise simple tree. The background of the image is blurred, drawing focus to the tree trunk and its inscribed hearts. Despite being a black and white image, it evokes a sense of warmth and affection, symbolized by the hearts.

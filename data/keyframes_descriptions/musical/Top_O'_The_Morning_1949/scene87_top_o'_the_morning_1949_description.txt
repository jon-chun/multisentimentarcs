This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of three individuals in a park. The man on the left, donned in a suit and hat, stands with his hands clasped behind his back. In the middle, another man, wearing a jacket and hat, has his arms crossed over his chest. On the right, a woman in a dress holds a parasol in her hand. They are positioned in front of a tree, which is situated on the left side of the frame. The background reveals more trees and foliage, creating a serene park setting. The monochrome palette adds a timeless quality to the scene.

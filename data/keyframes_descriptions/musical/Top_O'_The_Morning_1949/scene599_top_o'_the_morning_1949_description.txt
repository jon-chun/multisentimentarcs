Carl, played by Claude Rains, is also present in the scene but not clearly visible in this still. The characters are all dressed in period clothing, adding to the historical context of the film.

The lighting in the image is diffused, creating a soft and dramatic effect that highlights the characters' faces and expressions. The framing and composition of the image focus on the characters and their interactions, with the fountain and tree serving as a simple yet effective backdrop.

The image is a black and white movie still featuring two individuals in a room. The woman, positioned on the left side of the frame, is clad in a plaid dress and stands with her arms crossed. On the right side of the frame, the man is attired in a suit and tie, his hands casually tucked into his pockets. They are both looking off to the right side of the image, their expressions serious.

The room they occupy has wooden paneling on the walls and a staircase can be seen in the background. The lighting in the room appears to be dim, adding a sense of intimacy to the scene. The composition of the image places the two individuals at equal distances from the camera, creating a balanced visual dynamic. Despite being a black and white still, the image conveys a rich narrative through its elements including facial expressions, body language, props, and setting.

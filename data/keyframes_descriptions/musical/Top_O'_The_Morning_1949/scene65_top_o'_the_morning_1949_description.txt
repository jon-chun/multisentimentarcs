The cow, on the other hand, is black with white spots, providing a stark contrast against the lighter background. It stands calmly next to the man, seemingly at ease in their shared space.

The background of the image features trees and a building, indicating that this scene takes place outdoors during the day. The lighting is natural, suggesting it's daytime.

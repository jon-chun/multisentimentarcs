The image is a black and white sketch that captures a whimsical scene. At the center of the composition, a rabbit is depicted in mid-stride, carrying a basket on its back. The rabbit's body language suggests movement and purpose, as if it's on an important errand.

To the right of the rabbit, there's a wagon with large wheels. The wagon appears to be stationary, perhaps waiting for the rabbit to return. The positioning of the wagon and the rabbit creates a sense of balance in the image.

The background is filled with trees and hills, adding depth to the scene. The sketch style of the drawing adds an artistic touch to the image, making it feel like a storybook illustration.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of nostalgia and wonder, as if it's a snapshot from a fairy tale or a children's book. The use of black and white colors enhances the timeless quality of the scene.

This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Birds". The scene takes place in a garden, with a birdcage prominently featured. A woman, dressed in a long dress, stands to the left of the cage, her attention seemingly drawn towards it. On the right side of the cage, a man in a suit is seen walking away, his back turned to the camera. The birdcage itself is filled with birds, their bodies blurred due to the depth of field effect used by the photographer. The overall composition and use of light and shadow create a sense of tension and unease, reflecting the film's theme of nature's revenge against humanity.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a city street. The main subject of the image is a man, who is walking towards the camera while pulling a horse-drawn carriage behind him. He is dressed in a suit and hat, giving off an air of formality. In his other hand, he holds a sign that reads "For Sale", indicating some sort of transaction or sale.

The setting of the image is a city street lined with buildings on either side. There are people walking on the sidewalk, going about their day. The man pulling the carriage and the horse are positioned in the foreground, drawing the viewer's attention to them immediately. The people on the sidewalk are in the background, adding depth to the image.

The photograph is taken from a low angle, looking up at the man and the horse-drawn carriage. This perspective emphasizes the size of the horse and the carriage, making them appear larger than life compared to the pedestrians on the sidewalk.

Overall, the image evokes a sense of nostalgia and tells a story about a time when horses were used for transportation in cities. The black and white color scheme adds to this feeling, giving the image a timeless quality.

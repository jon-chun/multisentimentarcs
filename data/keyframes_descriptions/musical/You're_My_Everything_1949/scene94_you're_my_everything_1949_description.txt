In the image, there are three individuals seated around a table, engaged in what appears to be a social gathering. The person on the left is donned in a green hat and jacket, while the individual in the middle is wearing a blue dress complemented by a white headscarf. The third person, positioned on the right, is dressed in a black suit paired with a purple bowtie.

The table they are gathered around is adorned with various objects. There's a silver teapot, a glass filled with orange juice, and a plate of cookies among other items. The setting suggests an outdoor location, as evidenced by the river visible in the background along with buildings on the opposite bank.

The image captures a moment of camaraderie and leisure, set against the backdrop of a serene riverside. The colors, objects, and their arrangement contribute to creating an atmosphere of relaxation and enjoyment.

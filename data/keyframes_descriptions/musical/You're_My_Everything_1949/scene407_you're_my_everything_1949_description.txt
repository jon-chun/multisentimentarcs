He is dressed in a brown vest and a white shirt, standing with his arms crossed over his chest. On the right side of the frame, we see Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. He is wearing a blue suit and tie, looking at Don Vito with a concerned expression on his face. The background features a green wall adorned with framed pictures and a window dressed with curtains. The overall color scheme of the image is muted, adding to the serious and intense atmosphere of the scene.

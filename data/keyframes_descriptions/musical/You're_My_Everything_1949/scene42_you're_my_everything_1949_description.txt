The image captures a scene from the movie "Forrest Gump". The main focus is on three characters: Forrest Gump, Jenny Curran, and Bubba Blue. They are standing in front of a building with large windows. 

Forrest Gump, dressed in a blue suit and hat, is positioned on the left side of the image. He is looking towards Jenny and Bubba. On the right side of the image, we see Jenny Curran, who is wearing a black dress and a black hat. She is also looking at Forrest and Bubba. In the background, slightly to the right, stands Bubba Blue. He is wearing a brown suit and a white hat.

The characters' positions relative to each other and their actions suggest a conversation or interaction between them. The building with large windows serves as an interesting backdrop for this scene. The overall composition of the image creates a sense of depth and perspective.

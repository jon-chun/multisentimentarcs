In the image, a woman is seated on a red armchair in a living room setting. She is wearing a yellow and white checkered dress and has a black headpiece on her head. In her hands, she holds a blue ball of yarn, suggesting that she might be engaged in some form of knitting or crochet work.

The living room itself is furnished with a wooden coffee table positioned in front of the armchair. On the wall behind the woman hangs a painting, adding an artistic touch to the room. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a calm and peaceful domestic scene.

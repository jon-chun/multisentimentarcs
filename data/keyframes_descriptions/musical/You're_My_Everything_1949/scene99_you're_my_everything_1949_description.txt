Across from him, there's a woman wearing a blue dress and a gray hat. She appears to be engaged in conversation with Forrest Gump. The setting is a restaurant or cafe, characterized by a window that offers a view of trees outside. The overall color palette of the image is muted, with the exception of the vibrant blue of the woman's dress.

The background elements like the window and the trees add depth to the scene, creating a sense of space. The lighting in the image is soft, contributing to the overall calm and relaxed atmosphere of the setting.

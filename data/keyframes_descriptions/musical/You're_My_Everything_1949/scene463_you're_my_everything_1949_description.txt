The image is a movie poster for the film "The End". The background of the poster is blue, adorned with gold stars and a crescent moon. 

In the center of the poster, there's a man dressed in a red suit, holding a bouquet of roses. He stands on a white scroll that has a pink rose on it. To his right, there's a woman wearing a pink dress and a tiara, holding a gold scepter. She is positioned on a white pedestal with a gold base.

The title of the film, "The End", is written in yellow cursive text at the top of the poster. Below the title, it reads "Released through Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation". The text is clear and legible against the blue background.

The overall composition of the poster suggests a sense of grandeur and importance for the characters and the film's release. The use of color, positioning of the characters, and the text all contribute to this impression.

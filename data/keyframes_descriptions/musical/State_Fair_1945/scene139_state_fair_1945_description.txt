The image captures a scene from the movie "Oz the Great and Powerful". The focus is on three characters: China Girl, Glinda, and Evanora. They are standing in front of a building that has a sign with Chinese characters on it. 

China Girl, dressed in a pink dress adorned with blue flowers, stands out with her black hat. She seems to be observing the scene with interest. 

Glinda, wearing a white dress with a purple sash and a blue hat, is holding a parasol. Her gaze is directed towards something or someone off-screen, suggesting she might be engaged in a conversation or lost in thought.

Evanora, dressed in a purple dress and a black hat, holds a fan. She appears to be looking at China Girl, indicating an interaction between them.

The characters' positions relative to each other and their expressions suggest a moment of intrigue or anticipation. The setting and the characters' attire hint at a scene from a fantasy world, possibly set in ancient China given the Chinese characters on the sign.

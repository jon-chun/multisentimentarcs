In the image, there are two men standing in a field with hay bales in the background. The man on the left is wearing a white hat and a blue apron with a gold chain hanging from it. He has a surprised expression on his face. On the right, another man is seen wearing a beige hat and a blue shirt. He appears to be engrossed in a conversation on his cell phone. The overall scene suggests a rural setting, possibly a farm or a barnyard.

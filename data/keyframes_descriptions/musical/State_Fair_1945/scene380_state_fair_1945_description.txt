His attire is formal - a blue suit paired with a white shirt and a striped tie, suggesting an important occasion or meeting.

Opposite him, another man is seen wearing a gray suit and a striped tie, sitting across from Alain Delon on the same bench. He's looking directly at Alain Delon, his expression neutral but attentive, indicating an ongoing conversation or negotiation.

The setting appears to be outdoors, with trees visible in the background along with a car parked further away. The lighting is dim, casting soft shadows and adding to the overall mood of the scene. The composition of the image places Alain Delon on the left side of the frame, while the other man occupies the right side, creating a balanced visual dynamic.

The colors in the image are muted, with the blue of Alain Delon's suit standing out against the more subdued tones of the surroundings. The body language and gestures of both characters suggest a moment of tension or seriousness, perhaps indicative of an important conversation taking place.

Overall, this image captures a single, powerful moment from a film featuring Alain Delon, filled with subtle details that contribute to its overall impact.

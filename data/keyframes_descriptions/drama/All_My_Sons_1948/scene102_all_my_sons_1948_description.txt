This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Pulp Fiction". The image features three characters: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman.

John Travolta, dressed in a brown suit and tie, stands on the left side of the frame. His facial expression is serious as he looks off to the side, suggesting deep thought or contemplation.

In the center of the image is Samuel L. Jackson, wearing a green jacket and tie. He too appears to be lost in thought, his gaze directed away from the camera.

On the right side of the photo is Uma Thurman, clad in a white blouse and black skirt. She looks directly at the camera with a neutral expression on her face.

The setting is an outdoor garden, complete with trees and bushes visible in the background. The composition of the image places Travolta and Jackson in the foreground, drawing attention to their expressions and body language, while Thurman's position in the frame adds balance to the overall scene.

Despite being a still image, it conveys a sense of narrative and emotion, characteristic of the film "Pulp Fiction".

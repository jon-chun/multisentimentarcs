This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Casablanca". The image features four individuals, two men and two women, standing in front of a store. 

The man on the left is dressed in a formal suit and hat, exuding an air of sophistication. He stands next to a woman who is elegantly attired in a long dress and hat, her posture poised and graceful.

In the center of the frame, another man is seen wearing a military uniform, his stance firm and resolute. Beside him, a woman in a short skirt and blouse adds a contrasting element to the scene.

On the right, a woman in a polka dot dress and hat completes the quartet. Her attire stands out amidst the more formal clothing of her companions.

The store behind them is adorned with various items for sale, including a sign that reads "Cigarettes". The relative positions of the characters and their surroundings create a dynamic composition, each element contributing to the overall narrative of the image.

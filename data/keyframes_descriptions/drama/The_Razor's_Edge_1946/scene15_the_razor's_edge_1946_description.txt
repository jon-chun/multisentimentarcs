The man on the left is clad in a suit and tie, his arm securely wrapped around the woman's waist as they sway to an unseen rhythm. His partner, the woman, is adorned in a dress with a full skirt, her hand gently resting on the man's shoulder.

On the right, another man is seen wearing a tuxedo, his arm around the woman's waist mirroring the pose of the first couple. The woman on this side is dressed in a strapless gown, her posture echoing the dance steps of her companions.

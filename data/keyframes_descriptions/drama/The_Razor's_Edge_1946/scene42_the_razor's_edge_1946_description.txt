This is a black and white photograph capturing a tender moment between two individuals on a set of stairs. The person on the left, donned in a suit and hat, is embracing the person on the right, who is wearing a dress and holding a hat in their hand. They are positioned in front of a building with columns, which has a sign that reads "SUD". In the background, other people can be seen sitting on the stairs, adding to the bustling atmosphere of the scene. The monochrome palette enhances the timeless quality of this moment.

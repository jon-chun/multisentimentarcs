This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the early 20th century. The image features two women, one dressed in a long dress and the other in a shorter skirt, both adorned with hats. They are standing on a sidewalk, engaged in conversation. 

The woman on the left is holding a bouquet of flowers, adding a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome scene. Behind them, there's a building with a sign that reads "Bakery", suggesting they might be near a bakery or perhaps even inside one.

In the background, there are other people present, but their faces are blurred out, keeping the focus on the two women in the foreground. The overall composition of the image suggests a casual, everyday moment captured in time.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two women on a beach. The woman on the left, clad in a light-colored blouse with buttons running down the front, stands slightly behind her companion. Her gaze is directed towards the right, where the second woman is positioned. This woman is dressed in a darker-colored blouse, adorned with a single row of buttons at the top. Both women are looking out over the ocean, their attention seemingly drawn to something beyond the frame of the image. The photograph is taken from a slightly elevated angle, adding depth and perspective to the scene. The overall composition suggests a sense of tranquility and introspection.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a beach. The central figure in the image is a woman, elegantly dressed in a white dress with short sleeves and a collar. She stands confidently against the backdrop of the ocean, her gaze directed off to the side, suggesting a sense of contemplation or introspection.

The composition of the image places the woman in the center, drawing attention to her as the main subject. The camera angle is low, looking up at her, which adds to her imposing presence and dominance in the frame. The lighting appears natural, with the sun casting shadows on the sand behind her, indicating it might be midday.

The setting is a rocky beach, adding texture and contrast to the image. In the background, the ocean extends into the horizon, its vastness providing a sense of depth and scale to the scene.

Despite being in black and white, the image evokes a range of emotions from tranquility to introspection, largely due to the woman's expression and posture. The absence of color focuses attention on these elements, creating a timeless quality to the photograph. The film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and costumes to create this evocative image.

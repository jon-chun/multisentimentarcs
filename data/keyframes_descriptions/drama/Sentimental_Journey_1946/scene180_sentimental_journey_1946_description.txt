This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in a bedroom setting. The woman, dressed in a white dress, is standing behind the man who is seated at a table. She is pouring tea from a silver teapot into a cup on the table. The table also holds a plate of cookies and a newspaper. The man, wearing a collared shirt, is looking up at her with a smile on his face. The room has a bed visible in the background along with a lamp on a nightstand. The photograph evokes a sense of warmth and intimacy between the two characters.

On the right side of the photo, actress Monica Vitti mirrors Delon's serious expression. She too is dressed in a suit and tie, her posture echoing Delon's thoughtful demeanor.

The background reveals a room adorned with bookshelves, suggesting an intellectual setting. A window punctuates one wall, allowing a glimpse of the world outside. The monochrome palette enhances the dramatic atmosphere of the scene.

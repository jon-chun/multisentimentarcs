This is a black and white photograph capturing a lively scene on a river. The image features six boats, each carrying one or two individuals. The boats are scattered across the river, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the background.

The people in the boats appear to be engaged in various activities. Some are rowing, their oars dipping into the water in rhythmic strokes, while others seem to be enjoying a leisurely boat ride.

In the distance, beyond the river, stands a tall building. Its presence adds an urban touch to this otherwise natural scene. The sky above is clear, suggesting it might be a bright and sunny day.

Despite being a black and white image, the photograph manages to convey a sense of tranquility and leisurely enjoyment of a day out on the river.

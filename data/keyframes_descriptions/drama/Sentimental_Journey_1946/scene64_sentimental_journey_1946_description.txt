This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of tranquility on a rocky beach. The image features two women, both dressed in light-colored dresses that contrast with the dark tones of the surroundings.

The woman on the left stands slightly ahead of her companion, creating a sense of depth in the composition. She holds a parasol in her hand, a detail that adds an element of sophistication to her attire. Her gaze is directed towards something or someone off-frame, sparking curiosity about what might have caught her attention.

On the right, the other woman stands with her back to the camera, adding an air of mystery to her character. She seems to be looking out at the ocean, perhaps lost in thought or simply enjoying the view.

The rocky beach they stand on adds a rugged charm to the scene, while the ocean in the background provides a sense of vastness and freedom. The absence of color in the photograph enhances the timeless quality of this moment, focusing our attention on the subjects and their interaction with each other and their environment.

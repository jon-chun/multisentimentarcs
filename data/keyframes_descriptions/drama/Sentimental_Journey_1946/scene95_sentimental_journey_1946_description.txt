This is a black and white photograph capturing a tender moment between two young girls on a rocky beach. The girl on the left, dressed in a light-colored dress, stands with her hand gently placed on the shoulder of the other girl. She has long hair that falls softly around her shoulders. Her companion, wearing a darker-colored dress, is seated comfortably on a rock. Both girls are looking towards the camera, their faces lit up with smiles.

The setting is dramatic and natural, with the vast ocean stretching out behind them under an overcast sky. The rocky terrain they stand on adds to the rugged charm of the scene. Despite being in black and white, the photograph beautifully captures the innocence and joy of childhood.

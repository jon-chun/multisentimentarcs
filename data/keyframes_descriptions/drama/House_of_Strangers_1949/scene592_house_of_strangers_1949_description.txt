The image is a black and white movie still featuring three men standing in front of a staircase. The man on the left, dressed in a suit with a tie, has his hands tucked into his pockets. The man in the middle, also wearing a suit with a tie, stands slightly behind the other two men. The man on the right is dressed in a t-shirt and a boutonniere adorns his lapel. All three men are looking off to the side, their expressions serious. The staircase behind them has a railing and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The image evokes a sense of solemnity and formality.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men. The man on the left, donned in a suit and tie, sports a fedora hat and holds a newspaper in his hand. His counterpart on the right, also dressed in a suit and tie but with a bowler hat, is seen smoking a cigarette. They are seated side by side, their gazes directed towards something or someone outside of the frame. The background reveals a bustling street scene with other individuals going about their day. The photograph evokes a sense of nostalgia and tells a story that is open to interpretation.

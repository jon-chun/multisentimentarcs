The image is a black and white photograph capturing the exterior of the Monetti Trust and Loan Association. The building, constructed from brick, stands prominently in the frame. A signboard, affixed to the side of the building, announces "MONETTI TRUST AND LOAN ASSOCIATION JOSEPH MONETTI PRESIDENT ANTONIO MONETTI VICE PRESIDENT". The photograph is taken from a low angle, directing the viewer's gaze upwards towards the building and signboard. The absence of color in the image lends it a timeless quality, emphasizing the textures and details within the scene.

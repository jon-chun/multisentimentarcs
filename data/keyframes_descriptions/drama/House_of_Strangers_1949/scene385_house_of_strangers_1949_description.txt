This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in a room. The man on the left, dressed in a gray suit and tie, stands behind the man on the right, who is wearing a white shirt and has a bandage on his head. They are positioned in front of a desk that holds a lamp and a statue. The background features a window with curtains and a door adorned with a coat rack. The overall composition suggests an air of formality and solemnity.

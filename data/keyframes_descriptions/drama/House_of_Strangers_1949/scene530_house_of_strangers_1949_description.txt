The man's facial expression is one of intense concentration, as if he is deeply engrossed in the contents of the book that lies open before him on the desk. His hand holds a pen, poised above the page, ready to write or make notes.

The room around him is softly lit, with light filtering through curtains and illuminating a lamp on the desk. The overall lighting gives the scene a calm and serene atmosphere.

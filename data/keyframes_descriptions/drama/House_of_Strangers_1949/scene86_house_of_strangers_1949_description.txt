This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in time on a city street. The main subject of the image is a vintage car, specifically a 1936 Mercedes-Benz 540K, which is parked on the left side of the frame. The car's license plate reads "B 2616". 

The car is facing towards the right side of the photo, and there are three people standing next to it. Two of these individuals are positioned on the front left side of the car, while the third person stands on the back right side. All three individuals appear to be looking at something off-camera.

In the background, there's a building with a sign that reads "C. PALMIOTTI". The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of nostalgia and admiration for the vintage car.

This is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The main focus of the image is on two characters, a man and a woman. The man, dressed in a suit and tie, stands in front of a fireplace with a portrait of another man hanging above it. He is gesturing towards the woman, who is seated across from him. She is wearing a headband and holding a cigarette in her hand. The overall composition of the image suggests a scene of conversation or negotiation between the two characters.

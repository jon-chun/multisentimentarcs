This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two men in a field. The man on the left, clad in a leather jacket, stands with his back to the camera, while the man on the right, wearing a fur coat, faces the camera directly. They are positioned in front of a wire fence that stretches across the background. A building can be seen further in the distance. The photograph is taken from a low angle, adding a sense of depth and perspective to the scene. The absence of color focuses attention on the subjects' expressions and body language, which suggest a serious or intense interaction between them.

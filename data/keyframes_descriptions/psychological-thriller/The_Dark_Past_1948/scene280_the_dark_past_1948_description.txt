This is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The scene takes place in a living room with a fireplace and a clock on the wall. Three characters are present: Rick Blaine, Ilsa Rydahl, and Sam.

Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart, is seated at a chess table. He is wearing a suit and tie, and his expression is one of concern as he looks at Ilsa.

Ilsa Rydahl, played by Ingrid Bergman, is standing next to Rick. She is dressed in a long dress and her face reflects sadness as she looks at Sam.

Sam, played by Dooley Wilson, is also standing. He is wearing a white shirt and his expression is one of happiness as he looks at Ilsa.

The chess table between Rick and Ilsa has pieces arranged for a game that has just taken place. The fireplace in the background adds to the warm and intimate atmosphere of the scene. The clock on the wall suggests the passage of time, which is a significant theme in this film.

The black and white color scheme enhances the dramatic effect of the scene, highlighting the expressions and emotions of the characters. The positioning of the characters and their interactions - Rick's concern for Ilsa, Ilsa's sadness, Sam's happiness - all contribute to the overall narrative of the film. The chess game, which is a significant plot point in "Casablanca", is also depicted here, adding another layer of complexity to the scene.

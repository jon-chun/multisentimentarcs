This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a kitchen. The main subject of the image is a man, who is wearing a surgical cap and a shirt with a collar. He is standing at a counter, which has a sink and a window in the background. 

The man is holding a pen in his hand and appears to be writing or drawing on a piece of paper. His posture suggests that he is deeply engrossed in his task. 

In the foreground of the image, there's another person who is partially visible. This individual seems to be observing the man at the counter.

The lighting in the room is dim, adding a sense of intimacy and focus to the scene. The window in the background allows for some natural light to filter into the room.

The image is a black and white movie still from the film "A Place in the Sun". The scene captures a poignant moment between two characters, Elizabeth Ashley (the woman) and Gregory Peck (the man). They are positioned in a room adorned with curtains and a chandelier. 

Elizabeth Ashley, dressed in a light-colored blouse and dark pants, is seated on a bed. Her facial expression is one of sadness or contemplation as she gazes at the man standing next to her. Gregory Peck, wearing a dark-colored suit, stands beside her, his gaze directed towards her. The overall composition of the image suggests an intimate and emotional exchange between the two characters.

The screen displays a scene from what seems to be a historical drama or period film. It features three people dressed in traditional clothing, engaged in what appears to be an intense conversation. The man's attention is directed towards this scene, suggesting that he is deeply involved in the unfolding narrative.

The theater itself is dimly lit, with the only source of light coming from the screen.

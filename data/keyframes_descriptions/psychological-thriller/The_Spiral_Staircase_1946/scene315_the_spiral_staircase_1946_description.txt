This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". The central figure in the image is Dorothy Gale, portrayed by actress Judy Garland. She is standing in a bedroom adorned with floral wallpaper, positioned next to a bed covered with a white sheet. A nightstand is visible beside the bed, hosting a lamp and a vase.

Dorothy is dressed in a blue and white checkered dress, holding a pink parasol in her hand. Her facial expression is one of concern or worry, as she gazes off to the side, perhaps contemplating the events that have unfolded. The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of unease or uncertainty, reflecting the narrative of the film.

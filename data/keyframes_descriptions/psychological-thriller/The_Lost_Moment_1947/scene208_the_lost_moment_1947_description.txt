This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of quiet intimacy between two individuals seated at a table. The man, positioned on the left side of the frame, is dressed in a suit and tie, his attention seemingly focused on the woman across from him. The woman, on the right, is adorned in a long dress and veil, her gaze directed towards the man.

The table between them holds a lit candle, casting a warm glow that illuminates their faces and the objects around them. A small vase with flowers adds a touch of nature to the scene. The background features a window draped with curtains, suggesting an indoor setting.

The photograph is taken from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. This perspective emphasizes the relative positions of the man and woman, their attire, and the objects on the table. Despite being in black and white, the image conveys a sense of warmth and intimacy through its composition and lighting.

The portrait is placed on a wooden table, which adds a rustic charm to the scene. To the right of the portrait, there is a small glass bowl filled with fruit, adding a touch of nature and freshness to the composition.

In the background, slightly blurred but still noticeable, is a lamp with a black base and a white shade. The lamp's presence suggests a warm and inviting atmosphere in the room.

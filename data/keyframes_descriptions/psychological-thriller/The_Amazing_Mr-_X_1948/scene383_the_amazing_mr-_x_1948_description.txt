The camera angle is low, looking up at Monroe, which emphasizes her face and upper body against the backdrop. The lighting is diffused, casting soft shadows and highlighting Monroe's features, enhancing the overall mood of the photograph.

In terms of framing and composition, Monroe is slightly off-center in the frame, drawing the viewer's eye to her face while also allowing for exploration of the rest of the image. The background is blurred, ensuring that Monroe remains the focal point of the image.

The color palette is monochromatic due to the black and white nature of the photograph, but it's worth noting that Monroe's dress in this particular image is white, which stands out against the darker tones of her face and the background.

Monroe's body language and gestures suggest a sense of vulnerability or openness. She is wearing earrings, which are visible in the photograph, adding a touch of elegance to her appearance.

In terms of visual effects and post-processing, the image has been edited to have a grainy texture, giving it a vintage feel that complements Monroe's classic status as an icon of Hollywood glamour. The overall effect is a powerful portrait that captures Monroe's enduring allure and evokes a sense of nostalgia for her film career.

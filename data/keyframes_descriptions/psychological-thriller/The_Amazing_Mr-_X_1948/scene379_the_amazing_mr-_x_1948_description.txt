The image is a black and white photograph capturing the face of Marilyn Monroe, an iconic Hollywood actress. She is seen in profile, her head tilted slightly to the left as she gazes off into the distance with a thoughtful expression. The background is blurred, drawing focus to her face which occupies most of the frame. Her attire consists of a simple blouse, adding to the overall minimalist aesthetic of the image. The absence of color and the monochromatic palette lend a timeless quality to the photograph, emphasizing the subject's features and expression.

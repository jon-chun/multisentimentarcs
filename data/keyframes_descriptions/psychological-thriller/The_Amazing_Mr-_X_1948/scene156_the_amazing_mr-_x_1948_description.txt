The image presents a scene in black and white, focusing on a hand holding a white card. The card is emblazoned with the word "ALEXIS" in bold black letters at the top. Below this, the phrase "Psychic Consultant" is written in smaller black letters. The bottom of the card bears the address "6200 Warner Ave." in black letters. The hand holding the card appears to be in a relaxed state, suggesting a casual or informal setting. The background is blurred and indistinct, drawing attention to the card and the hand holding it. The overall composition suggests that the card might be an invitation or business card for a psychic consultant named Alexis.

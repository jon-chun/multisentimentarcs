The image is a black and white movie still capturing a dramatic scene. The main focus of the image is a person, who appears to be in a state of distress or fear. They are lying on their stomach on a rock, with their head turned towards the right side of the frame. Their body language suggests they might be screaming or crying.

The background of the image features a cliff and the ocean, adding to the intensity of the scene. The person is positioned in the foreground, while the cliff and ocean are in the background. This composition places emphasis on the person, making them the central element of this dramatic tableau.

In terms of lighting, there seems to be a single light source coming from the left side of the frame, casting shadows and highlighting certain areas of the scene. The absence of color due to the black and white nature of the image adds a timeless quality to the photograph.

Overall, the film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and visual effects to create a powerful and evocative scene. The use of black and white further enhances the dramatic effect of the image.

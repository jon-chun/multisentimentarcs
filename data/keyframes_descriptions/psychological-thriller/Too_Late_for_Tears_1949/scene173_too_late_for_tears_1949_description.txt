The image is a black and white movie still featuring the iconic actress Marilyn Monroe. She is standing in a living room, her body slightly turned to the side as she holds a phone to her ear with her left hand. Her right hand rests lightly on her hip, adding a sense of casualness to her posture. She's dressed in a light-colored dress adorned with a pattern, and a pair of gloves can be seen on her hands. The room around her is softly lit, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. A couch and a coffee table are visible in the background, suggesting a comfortable domestic setting.

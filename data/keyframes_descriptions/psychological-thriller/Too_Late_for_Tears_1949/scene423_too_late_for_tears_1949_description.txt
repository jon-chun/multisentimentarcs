The man, dressed in a white shirt, suspenders, and a bowler hat, stands behind the woman who is clad in a dark dress with a white collar. They are positioned in front of a dresser adorned with various objects including a mirror and a lamp. The photograph is taken from a low angle, emphasizing the height of the man and the woman's towering presence over him. The room is dimly lit, adding to the dramatic effect of the scene.

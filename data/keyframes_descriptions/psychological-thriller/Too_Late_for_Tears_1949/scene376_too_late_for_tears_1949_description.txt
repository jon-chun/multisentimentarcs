On the left side of the frame, there's Barbara Stanwyck, who plays the character of Phyllis Dietrich. She is dressed in a dark coat and hat, standing with her back to us, mirroring Edward G. Robinson's stance. Her position next to Fred MacArthur suggests she might be taking sides or playing a mediator role between them.

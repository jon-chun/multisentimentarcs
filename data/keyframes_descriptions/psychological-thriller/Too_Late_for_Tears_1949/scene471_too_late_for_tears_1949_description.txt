The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a city. The main focus of the image is a statue of a man, standing tall on a pedestal. The statue is positioned in front of a building with numerous windows, suggesting an urban setting. The perspective of the photo is from a low angle, looking up at the statue, which adds to its grandeur and prominence.

The lighting in the image is natural, coming from the sky above, illuminating the scene and casting shadows that add depth and contrast to the photograph. The composition of the image places the statue centrally, with the building serving as a backdrop, creating a sense of balance and harmony.

Despite being a black and white photo, the use of light and shadow creates a rich visual texture, from the smooth surface of the statue to the intricate details of the building's facade. The absence of color focuses the viewer's attention on the shapes, forms, and patterns within the image.

Overall, the photograph evokes a sense of solemnity and reverence towards the statue, as well as admiration for the architectural beauty of the cityscape. The film-maker has skillfully used various elements such as facial expression, camera angle, lighting, framing, setting, color, body language, props, and costumes to create a powerful and evocative image.

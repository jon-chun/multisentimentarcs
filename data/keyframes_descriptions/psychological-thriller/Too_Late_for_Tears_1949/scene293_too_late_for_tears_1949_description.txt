The image is a black and white movie still from the film "Roman Holiday" featuring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. The scene takes place in a hotel room, with Audrey Hepburn standing next to Gregory Peck. She is holding a drink in her hand and looking at him with a smile on her face. He is dressed in a suit and tie, and he looks at her with a serious expression. The room is furnished with a bed, a dresser, and a lamp. The overall mood of the image is light-hearted and romantic.

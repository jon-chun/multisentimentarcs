The image is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The scene takes place in a room with a desk and a window. Two men are present in the frame, one standing and the other sitting at the desk.

The man standing is dressed in a suit and tie, holding a pen in his hand. His posture suggests he is engaged in conversation or perhaps writing something down. He is positioned slightly to the left of the center of the image.

The man sitting at the desk is wearing a hat and glasses. He appears to be listening intently to the standing man, indicating an interaction between them. He is seated on the right side of the image.

The room they are in has a window and a desk with a lamp on it. The window allows light to enter the room, illuminating the scene. The lamp on the desk provides additional lighting, creating a contrast between the lit and unlit areas of the room.

The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, emphasizing the emotions and expressions of the characters rather than focusing on specific colors or details. The composition of the image, with its focus on the two men and their interaction, suggests a narrative that is central to the plot of "Casablanca".

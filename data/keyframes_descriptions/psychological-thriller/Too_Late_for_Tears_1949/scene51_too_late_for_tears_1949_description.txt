The image is a black and white movie still capturing a moment of interaction between two women. The woman on the left, dressed in a light-colored blouse, stands with her back to the camera, her gaze directed towards the right. On the right, another woman, clad in a dark-colored dress, faces the camera directly, her attention seemingly focused on the first woman. They are positioned against a backdrop of a room furnished with a desk and a window. The monochrome palette of the image adds a timeless quality to the scene.

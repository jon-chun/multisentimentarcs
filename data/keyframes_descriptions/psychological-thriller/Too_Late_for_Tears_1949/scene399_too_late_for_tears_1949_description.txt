The image is a black and white still from the movie "Casablanca". The scene captures a moment of tension between two men in a room. On the left, a man dressed in a suit stands with his back to us, his attention focused on another man who is seated at a desk. This second man, wearing a hat, is positioned in front of a large window that allows light to stream into the room. The positioning of the characters and their expressions suggest a confrontation or disagreement. The use of black and white film adds a dramatic effect, emphasizing the intensity of the scene.

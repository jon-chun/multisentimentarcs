This is a black and white movie still from the film "The Public Enemy" featuring two main characters, Tom Hardy (the man in the suit) and Meryl Strype (the woman). The setting is a room with a window in the background. 

Tom Hardy, portraying the character of Paul Varney, is seated on a chair. He is wearing a three-piece suit and holding a hat in his hand. His facial expression is one of concern or worry.

Meryl Strype, playing the character of Mattie Gibbons, is standing behind Tom Hardy. She is dressed in a long-sleeved dress and her posture suggests she is listening intently to what Tom Hardy has to say.

The room they are in has a window with curtains on it, suggesting an indoor setting. The overall composition of the image places Tom Hardy as the central figure, with Meryl Strype positioned behind him, adding depth to the scene.

The black and white color scheme adds a timeless quality to the image, emphasizing the dramatic expressions on the characters' faces and the stark contrast between light and shadow. The absence of color also draws attention to the textures in the scene, from the fabric of Tom Hardy's suit to the folds of Meryl Strype's dress.

The props and costumes used in this still - the hat held by Tom Hardy, the long-sleeved dress worn by Meryl Strype - are indicative of the period setting of the film. The hat suggests a sense of style or status, while the dress reflects the fashion of the time.

In terms of body language and gestures, both characters appear to be engaged in a serious conversation, their expressions reflecting the gravity of their discussion. The positioning of Tom Hardy on the chair and Meryl Strype standing behind him further emphasizes this dynamic.

The depth of field is shallow, with the focus primarily on Tom Hardy and his expression. This effect also highlights the details of Meryl Strype's dress and the textures in the room.

Overall, the film-maker has used a combination of facial expressions, camera angles, lighting, framing, composition, setting, color, body language, gestures, props, costumes, depth of field, character positioning, and interaction to create a powerful and evocative scene.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between two individuals in what appears to be a bar or restaurant setting. The person on the left, clad in a sequined dress, holds a lit cigarette in their hand, casting a soft glow that contrasts with the otherwise monochrome image. On the right, another individual is seen wearing a suit and tie, holding a drink in their hand. The background features a painting adorning the wall, adding an artistic touch to the scene. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a casual yet intimate atmosphere between the two individuals.

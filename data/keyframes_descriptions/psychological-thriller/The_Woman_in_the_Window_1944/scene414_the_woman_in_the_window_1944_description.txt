This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". The image features two main characters, Dorothy Gale and the Scarecrow. They are positioned in front of a mirror, which reflects their images. 

Dorothy Gale, dressed in a vibrant dress adorned with a floral pattern, stands on the left side of the frame. Her gaze is directed towards the mirror, her expression one of surprise or shock. 

On the right side of the frame, we see the Scarecrow. He is attired in a suit and tie, his posture upright as he too looks at the mirror with an expression of surprise.

The background of the image reveals a dark room, adding to the dramatic effect of the scene. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling, its intricate design visible even in the monochrome setting. The positioning of the characters and their expressions suggest a significant event or discovery taking place within this narrative frame.

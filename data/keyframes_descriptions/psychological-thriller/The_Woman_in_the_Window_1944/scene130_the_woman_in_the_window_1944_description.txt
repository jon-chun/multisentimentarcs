The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment on a rainy night. The central figure is a man, dressed in a dark suit and hat, walking away from the camera. He holds a briefcase in his right hand, suggesting he might be returning home or heading to work despite the inclement weather.

In the foreground, there's another person holding a camera, possibly capturing the same scene as us. The background features a building with a glass window reflecting the darkness of the night. A tree stands next to the building, its branches likely glistening with raindrops.

The overall composition creates a sense of solitude and determination, as the man in the suit continues his journey despite the rain. The presence of the photographer adds an element of intrigue, making us wonder about their intentions and relationship with the subject. The black and white color scheme enhances the moodiness of the scene, emphasizing the contrast between light and dark, and adding depth to the image.

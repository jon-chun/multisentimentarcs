The image is a black and white movie still from the film "An Affair to Remember". The main subject is Cary Grant, portraying the character of David Smith. He is standing in a living room, positioned next to a lamp that has a white shade with a gold base. His attire consists of a black suit, a white hat, and he is holding a cigar in his right hand. In the background, there's another person who appears to be a woman, dressed in a long dress. The overall composition of the image suggests a scene from an older era, possibly reflecting the time period when the film was made.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment between three men in suits. The man on the left, donning a fedora, stands with his hands clasped behind his back. In the middle, another man in a suit holds a briefcase, standing with his arms crossed over his chest. On the right, the third man, also wearing a suit and a hat, has his hands tucked into his pockets. They are all positioned in front of a brick wall adorned with a sign that reads "Caf√©". The monochrome palette adds a timeless quality to this scene.

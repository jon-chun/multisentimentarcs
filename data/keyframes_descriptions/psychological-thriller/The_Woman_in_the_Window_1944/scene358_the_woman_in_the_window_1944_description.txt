The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of quiet introspection. The central figure is a woman, elegantly dressed in a long-sleeved dress adorned with beaded embroidery on the bodice and sleeves. She is seated comfortably on a patterned couch, her legs crossed in a relaxed manner.

In her left hand, she holds a glass of wine, its stem delicately balanced between her fingers. Her gaze is directed off to the side, suggesting deep thought or contemplation. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on the woman and the use of black and white tones, evokes a sense of nostalgia and timeless elegance.

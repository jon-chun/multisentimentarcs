This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in time at the "P. J. Gymnasium". The image features two vintage cars, one of which is a Model T Ford, parked on a street. A man is standing next to the Model T Ford, his attention seemingly drawn towards something off-frame. The other car, a Model A Ford, is positioned in front of the gymnasium building. The gymnasium sign is clearly visible against the backdrop of the building. The overall composition of the image suggests a sense of nostalgia and a glimpse into a bygone era.

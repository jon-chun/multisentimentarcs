This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of interaction between two men inside a car. The man on the left, dressed in a suit and tie, is seated with his legs crossed. He holds a cigar in his hand, suggesting a relaxed or contemplative mood. His gaze is directed towards the man on the right.

The man on the right, also wearing a suit and tie, has his arms crossed over his chest. He appears to be engaged in conversation with the first man, as indicated by their direct eye contact. The positioning of their bodies and the use of props like the cigar suggest a sense of camaraderie or shared experience.

The car's interior is visible, providing context for the setting. The stone wall outside the window adds an element of texture and depth to the image. Despite being in black and white, the photograph conveys a rich narrative through its composition and the expressions on the men's faces.

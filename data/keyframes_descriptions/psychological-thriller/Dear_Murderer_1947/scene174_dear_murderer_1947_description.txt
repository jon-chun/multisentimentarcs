This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the movie "Casablanca". The image features two main characters, Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart. Ingrid Bergman, dressed in a long dark coat, stands near a window draped with curtains. She holds a book in her hands, suggesting she might be reading or about to start. On the other side of the room, Humphrey Bogart is seen wearing a suit and tie, holding a glass of whiskey in his hand. The setting appears to be an indoor room with a desk and chair visible in the background. The overall composition of the image suggests a quiet, introspective moment between the two characters.

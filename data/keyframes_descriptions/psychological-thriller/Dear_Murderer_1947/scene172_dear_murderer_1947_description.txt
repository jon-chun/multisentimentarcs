The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actress Marilyn Monroe. She is standing in a room, her body slightly tilted to one side as she gazes off to the side with a pensive expression on her face. The room around her is elegantly decorated, with curtains adorning the windows and a chandelier hanging from the ceiling. A table set for two can be seen in the background, complete with wine glasses and a bottle of champagne. Monroe's attire consists of a black dress, adding to the overall monochrome aesthetic of the image. The composition of the image places Monroe as the central figure, with the room's furnishings and decorations serving as the backdrop to her contemplative pose.

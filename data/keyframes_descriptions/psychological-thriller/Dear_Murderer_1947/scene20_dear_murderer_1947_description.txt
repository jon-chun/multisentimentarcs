The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of anticipation. The main focus is a ticket stub from the New York Police Department, dated May 26, 1983. The stub is crumpled and bears the marks of time with slight tears around the edges.

The text on the stub reveals that it was purchased for $1.50 at the Frank M. Gidley County Court in London SW 10. The ticket stub also carries a message from Mrs. Warren B. Myrie to Mr. James E. Lee, expressing hope that he will leave for some time soon.

The photograph is taken from an angle, giving us a glimpse of the stub's top left corner and its slightly crumpled texture. The background is blurred, drawing our attention to the ticket stub in sharp focus. Despite being a simple object, the ticket stub tells a story, evoking emotions of nostalgia and anticipation for what lies ahead.

The image is a black and white photograph capturing a moment of intimacy. The central focus is a handwritten note resting on a table, its message poignant and personal. The text, penned in cursive, reads: "Dear Mother, I have suffered a perfoliate so long that I feel not you suffer since I have been away from home. I let you think I was well but I should do better. I hope you are comfortable. No longer yours, Vivian." 

The note is signed by the author, indicating a personal connection between the writer and the recipient. The handwriting suggests a sense of urgency or confession, hinting at the emotional weight of the message.

In the background, a hand can be seen holding a pen, perhaps the instrument used to write the note. This detail adds a layer of narrative, suggesting that the act of writing is still ongoing.

The photograph itself has a grainy texture, adding a sense of nostalgia or timelessness to the scene. The black and white color scheme enhances this effect, stripping away distractions and focusing the viewer's attention on the emotional content of the image.

Overall, the image evokes a range of emotions, from sadness and regret to hope and resilience. It's a snapshot of a moment that feels both personal and universal, capturing the complexity of human relationships and the power of words to express and heal.

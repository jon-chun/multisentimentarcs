The image is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The scene captures a moment between two characters, Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart, seated at a table in a caf√©. Ingrid Bergman, dressed in a white dress adorned with black trim and a pearl necklace, is on the left side of the frame. She is looking down at her hands, her face etched with a look of concern. On the right side of the frame, Humphrey Bogart, wearing a suit and tie, looks up at Bergman with an expression of worry. The background features a window draped with curtains and a plant on the windowsill. The overall composition creates a sense of tension and anticipation between the characters.

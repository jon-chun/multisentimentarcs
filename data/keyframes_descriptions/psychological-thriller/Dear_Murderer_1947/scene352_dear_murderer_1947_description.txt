A man, dressed in a suit, is seated on a couch while a woman stands behind him. The man's facial expression is one of concern or worry, as indicated by his furrowed brows and tense posture. The woman, standing slightly to the left of the man, holds a small black clutch purse in her hand. The room they are in has a grandiose feel, emphasized by the chandelier and the ornate decorations on the walls. The overall mood of the image is one of tension and suspense, which is typical for this film genre.

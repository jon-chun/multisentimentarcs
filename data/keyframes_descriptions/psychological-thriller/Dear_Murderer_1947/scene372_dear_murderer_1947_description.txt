The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actress Marlene Dietrich. She is standing in a room, her gaze directed off to the side, embodying a serious expression on her face. The room around her is adorned with a painting hanging on the wall behind her, adding an artistic touch to the scene. A window can be seen further back, allowing some light to filter into the room. Marlene Dietrich is dressed in a black dress that contrasts sharply with the lighter tones of the room. Her hair is styled in loose curls, framing her face beautifully. The monochrome palette of the image enhances the dramatic effect of the scene.

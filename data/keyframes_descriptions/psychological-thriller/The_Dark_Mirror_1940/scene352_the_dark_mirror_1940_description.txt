The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actor Alain Delon. He is standing in front of a desk, which has a telephone on it. His arms are crossed over his chest and he is deep in thought, looking off to the side. The room behind him has a window and a bookshelf. The overall mood of the image is serious and contemplative.

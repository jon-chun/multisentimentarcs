This is a black and white movie still from the film "Casablanca". The scene takes place in a living room adorned with floral wallpaper. A man, dressed in a suit and hat, stands behind a couch where a woman is seated. She is wearing a black dress and a pearl necklace. Another man, also in a suit and hat, stands next to the couch. The sentiment of the image is one of tension and suspense as suggested by the characters' body language and facial expressions. The film-maker has used elements such as camera angle, lighting, framing, color, depth of field, character positioning, and visual effects to create this atmosphere.

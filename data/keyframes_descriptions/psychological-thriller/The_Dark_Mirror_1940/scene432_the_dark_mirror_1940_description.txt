The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actress Ingrid Bergman. She is seated on a chair in what appears to be a room with curtains in the background. Ingrid Bergman is wearing a black dress, adorned with a pearl necklace, and her hair is styled in an updo. Her facial expression is one of concern or worry, as she looks off to the side. The overall composition of the image suggests a dramatic scene from a film.

This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment from the classic film "Casablanca". The image features three main characters: Ilsa Lund, Rick Blaine, and Sam.

Ilsa Lund, played by Ingrid Bergman, is positioned on the left side of the frame. She is dressed in a light-colored dress adorned with ruffles at the collar and hem, adding a touch of elegance to her appearance. Her facial expression is one of concern as she looks towards Rick Blaine.

Rick Blaine, portrayed by Humphrey Bogart, stands in the center of the image. He is wearing a dark suit and tie, exuding an air of sophistication. His gaze is directed towards Ilsa, reflecting a sense of longing and unspoken emotions between them.

On the right side of the frame is Sam, played by Dooley Wilson. He is dressed in a white shirt and black pants, providing a stark contrast to Rick's dark attire. Sam holds a tray with two glasses on it, suggesting that he might be serving drinks at this gathering.

The background features a floral wallpapered wall with framed pictures hanging above the fireplace, adding depth and context to the scene. The monochrome color scheme enhances the timeless quality of this cinematic moment.

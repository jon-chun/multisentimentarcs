To his right, Robert De Niro, playing the character Don Vito Corleone, is holding a cigar in his hand. He is also wearing a suit and tie, but his expression is more serious and contemplative.

On Michael's left, Diane Lane, portraying the character Carmela Corleone, is seen walking away from the camera. She too is dressed in a suit and tie, mirroring the formal attire of the other characters.

In the background, Peter Boyle, playing the character Detective Fredo Corleone, can be seen standing near a counter with a cash register on it. He appears to be observing the scene unfolding before him.

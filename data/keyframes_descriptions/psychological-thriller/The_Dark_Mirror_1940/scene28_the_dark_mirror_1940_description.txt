In this black and white photo, we see a scene from the movie "The Shop Around the Corner". The main focus is on two characters: Alfred Molina, portraying the character of George Hepworth, and Rene Clair, playing the role of Anna Manni. They are standing in front of a counter that is filled with various items for sale.

George Hepworth, wearing a hat and a bow tie, has his hands clasped together as he looks at Anna. His body language suggests a sense of anticipation or curiosity about what Anna might say next. 

Anna Manni, dressed in a blouse and a skirt, stands behind the counter. She is looking at George with a slight smile on her face, indicating a friendly or welcoming demeanor.

The background features a shelf filled with books and a mirror hanging on the wall, adding depth to the scene. The lighting in the room is dim, creating an intimate atmosphere. The overall composition of the image suggests a quiet moment between the two characters, possibly hinting at a romantic connection between them.

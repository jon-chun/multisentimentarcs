The image is a black and white movie still featuring the actress Ingrid Bergman. She is standing in a room with curtains visible in the background. Her attire consists of a strapless dress, and she has her hair styled in an updo. The expression on her face is one of concern or worry, suggesting that the scene might be from a dramatic film. The monochrome color scheme adds to the overall mood of the image.

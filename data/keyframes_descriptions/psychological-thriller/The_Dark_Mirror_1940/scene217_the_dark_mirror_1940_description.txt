In the image, we see the renowned actor Alain Delon, portraying his character John Bridger from the film "The Swimming Pool". He is seated at a desk in a room adorned with a deer head on the wall and framed pictures. Dressed in a crisp white suit and tie, he holds a glass of whiskey in his right hand while his left hand rests on a piece of paper. His expression is serious as he gazes into the distance, lost in thought. The monochrome palette of the image adds to its dramatic effect.

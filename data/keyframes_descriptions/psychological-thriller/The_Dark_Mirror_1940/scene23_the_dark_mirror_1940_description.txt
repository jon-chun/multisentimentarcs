This is a black and white photograph capturing a moment in a store. The image features three individuals: two women and one man. 

The woman on the left, clad in a gray dress, is smiling at the camera, her gaze directed towards it. She stands behind a counter that houses a cash register and stacks of books.

In the center of the frame, a man dressed in a black suit is also looking at the camera. He holds a pen in his hand, suggesting he might be signing something or perhaps conducting a transaction.

On the right, another woman is present. She is wearing a fur coat and holding a hat in her hands. Like the other two individuals, she too is looking at the camera.

The store itself has shelves filled with various items, indicating it's well-stocked. A window can be seen in the background, although its contents are not discernible from this angle.

Please note that as this is a black and white image, specific colors of objects cannot be determined.
